"Once upon a time, an English journalist came to New York."
Right away she hooked up with one of the city's typically eligible bachelors.
The question remains Is this really a company we want to own?
Tim was a well liked and respected investment banker who made about two million a year.
"They met one evening, in typical New York fashion at a gallery opening."
I feel like I know you from somewhere.
I only just moved here from London.
That's my all time favorite city.
It was love at first sight.
You know I think perhaps I have met you somewhere before.
For two weeks they snuggled went to romantic restaurants had wonderful sex and shared their most intimate secrets.
One warm spring day he took her to a town house he saw in Sunday's New York Times.
How 'bout if we start at the top and work our way down?
"That day, Tim popped the question."
How'd you like to have dinner with my folks Tuesday night?
"On Tuesday, he called with some bad news."
My mother's not feeling very well.
Could we take a rain check?
Tell your mum I hope she feels better.
"When she hadn't heard from him for two weeks, she called."
That's an awfully long rain check.
He said he was up to his ears and that he'd call her the next day.
"He never did call, of course."
She told me one day over coffee.
"In England, looking at houses together would have meant something."
Then I realized no one had told her about the end of love in Manhattan.
Welcome to the age of un innocence.
"No one has breakfast at Tiffany's, and no one has affairs to remember."
"Instead, we have breakfast at a.m."
and affairs we try to forget as quickly as possible.
Self protection and closing the deal are paramount.
Cupid has flown the co op.
How the hell did we get into this mess?
"There are thousands, maybe tens of thousands of women like this in the city."
"We all know them, and we all agree they're great."
They'll spend on a pair of Manolo Blahnik strappy sandals.
It's like the riddle of the Sphinx.
Why are there so many great unmarried women and no great unmarried men?
I explore these sorts of issues in my column and I have terrific sources: my friends.
"When you're a young guy in your , women are controlling the relationship."
So by the time you're an eligible man in your you feel like you're being devoured by women.
"Suddenly, the guys are holding all the chips."
I call it the mid power flip.
It's all about age and biology.
"I mean, if you want to get married, it's to have kids, right?"
Not with someone older than 'cause you have to have kids right away and that's about it.
I think these women should just forget about marriage and have a good time.
I have a friend who'd always gone out with extremely sexy guys and just had a good time.
"One day she woke up, and she was"
She couldn't get any more dates.
She had a complete physical breakdown couldn't hold her job and moved back to Wisconsin to live with her mother.
Trust me this is not a story that makes men feel bad.
Most men are threatened by successful women.
"If you want to get these guys, you have to keep your mouth shut and play by the rules."
I totally believe that love conquers all.
Sometimes you just have to give it a little space and that's exactly what's missing in Manhattan the space for romance.
Older women don't want to settle for what's available.
"By the time you reach your mid you think, Why should I settle?"
"It's like the older we get, the more we keep self selecting down to a smaller and smaller group."
What women really want is Alec Baldwin.
There's not one woman in New York who hasn't turned down wonderful guys because they were too short or too fat or too poor.
"I have been out with some of those guys the short, fat, poor ones."
They are just as self centered and unappreciative as the good looking ones.
Why don't these women just marry a fat guy?
"Why don't they just marry a big, fat tub of lard?"
"Happy birthday, dear Miranda Happy birthday to you"
Another something birthday with a group of unmarried female friends.
We would all have preferred a nice celebratory conference call.
"If you're a successful single woman in this city, you have two choices: You can bang your head against the wall and try and find a relationship or you can say screw it, and just go out and have sex like a man."
Samantha was a New York inspiration.
A public relations executive she routinely slept with good looking guys in their .
Remember that guy I was going out with?
"Oh, God, what was his name?"
"It was like, Hey, babe, gotta go."
And I completely forgot about him after that.
But are you sure that isn't just 'cause he didn't call you?
"Sweetheart, this is the first time in the history of Manhattan that women have had as much money and power as men plus the equal luxury of treating men like sex objects."
"Yeah, except men in this city fail on both counts."
"I mean, they don't want to be in a relationship with you but as soon as you only want them for sex, they don't like it."
All of a sudden they can't perform the way they're supposed to.
"Ladies, are we really that cynical?"
"It's like that guy, Jeremiah, the poet."
"I mean, the sex was incredible."
"But then he wanted to read me his poetry and go out to dinner and the whole chat bit, and I'm like, Let's not even go there."
That you're just going to give up on love?
"Believe me the right guy comes along, and you two here, this whole thing right out the window."
The right guy is an illusion.
So you think it's really possible to pull off this whole women having sex like men thing?
"Okay, Linda Fiorentino fucking that guy up against the chain link fence."
"And never having one of those Oh, my God, what have I done?"
Were women in New York really giving up on love and throttling up on power?
I'm beginning to think the only place one can still find love and romance in New York is the gay community.
It's straight love that's become closeted.
Stanford Blatch was one of my closest friends.
"He owned a talent agency and, at the moment, was down to a single client."
"So, are you telling me that you're in love?"
How could I possibly sustain a relationship?
"You know Derek takes up like, a thousand percent of my time."
Don't you think that's a bit obsessive?
His career is all I care about.
"When that's under control, then I can concentrate on my personal life."
With a billboard in Times Square.
The loathe of your life is at the bar.
It was Kurt Harrington a mistake I made when I was and and
Do you think I'm a masochist?
Because I don't have the patience to clean up this mess for the fourth time.
I don't have a shred of feeling left.
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to visit the ladies' room."
I no longer felt a thing for Kurt.
"After all these years, I finally saw him for what he was: a self centered, withholding creep who was still the best sex I ever had in my life."
"However, I did have a little experiment in mind."
"Oh, you know, just writing the column."
So what are you doing later?
I thought you weren't talking to me for the rest of your life.
"What do you say to my place,"
Are you out of your mind?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Kurt was just like I remembered better because this time there would be none of that messy emotional attachment.
I have to go back to work.
But I'll give you a call.
Maybe we can do it again sometime.
"As I began to get dressed, I realized that I'd done it."
I'd just had sex like a man.
"I left feeling powerful, potent and incredibly alive."
I felt like I owned this city.
Nothing and no one could get in my way.
"Number two, he's not wearing a wedding ring."
"Number three, he knows I carry textured Trojans with a reservoir tip."
"Later that night, Skipper met me for coffee and confessed a shocking intimate secret."
"Do you know that it has been, like, a year?"
I just have so much feeling.
Are you sure you're not gay?
I'm sensitive and I don't objectify women.
"You know, most guys, when they meet a girl the first thing that they see is You know"
Don't you have any friends that you can hook me up with?
"We're all going downtown to this club, Chaos."
She'd think he was mocking her with his sweet nature and decide he was an asshole the way she had decided all men were assholes.
"Look, I can't meet you guys for dinner tomorrow night because I have an amazing date."
He's supposedly some big shot in the publishing world.
He was one of the city's most notoriously un gettable bachelors.
"Wait, don't even answer that question because, frankly, I don't care."
I'm not buying any of that women having sex like men crap.
I didn't tell her about my afternoon of cheap and easy sex and how good it felt.
"Have a good time, and promise to tell me everything."
It was just like that bar in Cheers where everybody knows your name except here they were likely to forget it five minutes later.
"Still, it was the creme de la creme of New York whipped into a frenzy."
Sometimes you got a souffle sometimes cottage cheese.
It is like a model bomb exploded in this room tonight.
Is there a woman here aside from me who weights more than a hundred pounds?
"I know, it's like Undereaters Anonymous."
I have this theory that men secretly hate pretty girls because they rejected them in school.
But if you're not part of the Beauty Olympics you can still become a very interesting person.
Are you saying that I'm not pretty enough?
"So, ipso f acto, I can't be interesting?"
"Women fall into one of two categories: beautiful and boring or homely and interesting, is that it?"
"No, that's not what I meant."
Is this your hand on my knee?
"Let's just keep 'em where I can see 'em, all right?"
"Well, I guess you must find me beautiful."
"I was about to rescue Skipper from an increasingly hopeless situation, when suddenly"
"Lucky me, twice in one week."
"Well, I don't know if you're going to be getting that lucky."
"You know, I was really pissed off the way you left the other day."
You finally understand the kind of relationship I want and now we can have sex without commitment.
"So when I feel like it, I'll call you."
"If I'm alone, I'm all yours."
Did all men secretly want their women promiscuous and emotionally detached?
"And if I was really having sex like a man, why didn't I feel more in control?"
He's the next Donald Trump except he's younger and much better looking.
I've never seen him in my life.
"He usually dates models, but, hey, I'm as good looking as a model plus I own my own business."
Samantha had the kind of deluded self confidence that caused men like Ross Perot to run for president and it usually got her what she wanted.
"Well, if you're not gonna hit on him, I will."
And there she went off to take her best shot with Big.
"Meanwhile, Charlotte York was having a splendid evening with Capote Duncan."
Wanna go back to my place and see the Ross Blechner?
"I'd love to, but it's really getting late."
What year was it painted again?
Though Charlotte was determined to play hard to get she didn't want to end the evening too abruptly.
"Well, maybe just for a minute."
This could easily go for a hundred grand.
Ross is so hot right now.
I have to get up really early tomorrow.
Charlotte told me she thought she had played the entire evening flawlessly.
"So, what are you doing next Saturday?"
"You're going to the West Side, right?"
Two stops: Fourth and Bank and West Broadway and Broom.
"Look, I understand where you're coming from and I totally respect it but I really need to have sex tonight."
Back at Chaos things were swinging into high gear and Samantha was putting the moves on Big.
I've been smoking cigars for years back when they were terminally uncool.
I've got this great source that sends me Hondurans.
Do you want to try one?
"Look, I do the PR for this club and I have the key to the private room downstairs."
"No, thanks, but maybe another time."
Meanwhile Skipper was hopelessly smitten with Miranda Hobbes.
"Listen, Skippy you know, you really are a nice, sweet guy, but"
Miranda told me later that she thought he was too nice but that she was willing to overlook one flaw and Capote Duncan found his fix for the night.
I wanna see the Ross Blechner.
"Oh, listen, l I gotta get up really early and, actually, you can't stay over."
I have to get up really early too.
And so another Friday night in Manhattan crept towards dawn.
Just when I thought I would have to do the unspeakable walk home
"Well, get in, for Christ's sakes."
"So, what have you been doing lately?"
You mean besides going out every night?
"I mean, what do you do for work?"
I'm sort of a sexual anthropologist.
I write a column called Sex and the City.
Right now I'm researching an article about women who have sex like men.
"You know, they have sex and then afterwards they feel nothing."
Suddenly I felt the wind knocked out of me.
I wanted to crawl under the covers and go right to sleep.
Have you ever been in love?
Last night my friend Miranda got invited to a dinner party by a man she hardly knew.
She was the date of Nick a fairly successful sports agent who once told her she had nice legs.
Old movie stars you'd have liked to fuck when they were young.
"Veronica Lake, the year she made Sullivan's Travels."
I'd have to say Sophia Loren.
Probably 'cause my dad had this thing for her.
"Marilyn Monroe, before the Kennedys got to her."
"Bing Crosby, I stand by my choice"
"For a first date, Miranda felt like she was hitting it out of the ballpark."
So how long have you known Nick?
We've been riding the same elevator line for years and then we had lunch a few weeks ago and then he invited me here to dinner.
Guess he took our ultimatum seriously.
They told Miranda that Nick had this thing for models.
Old movie stars you'd have liked to fuck when they were young.
"Veronica Lake, the year she made Sullivan's Travels."
I'd have to go with Sophia Loren.
My dad had a thing for her.
They'd come to dinner push their food around and pout.
She had to make a phone call.
It got to be a problem.
Can't you find a woman who can carry on a decent conversation?
You can't bring around any more of these so called models.
I'll see what I can do.
"Miranda confronted him, and it didn't take him long to fold."
Your intellectual beard for the evening?
"You gotta admit, you met some nice people."
You were on a date with a modelizer and you didn't even know it?
"If men like Nick are dating models, what chance do ordinary women have?"
Do you have to be a supermodel to get a date in New York?
They're a step beyond womanizers who will sleep with just about anything in a skirt.
"Modelizers are obsessed not with women, but with models who in most cities are safely confined to billboards and magazines but in Manhattan, actually run wild on the streets turning the city into a virtual Model Country Safari where men can pet the creatures in their natural habitat."
As if we didn't have enough problems.
They're stupid and lazy and should be shot on sight.
"I've been out with lots of guys and they say I am just as beautiful as a model, but I work for a living."
"I'm like, well I'm like a model who's taken the high road."
"The advantages given to models and to beautiful women in general are so unfair, it makes me puke."
Cute doesn't cut it in this town.
There's nothing like raising the subject of models among four single women to spice up an otherwise dull Tuesday night.
"They have this distant, sexy look."
That's starvation in the best restaurants.
What I wanna know is when did all the men get together and decide that they would only get it up for giraffes with big breasts?
"In some cultures, heavy women with mustaches are considered beautiful."
You're looking at me while you're saying that?
We should just admit that we live in a culture that promotes impossible standards of beauty.
"No matter how good I feel about myself if I see Christy Turlington, I just wanna give up."
"I wanna force feed her lard, but that's the difference between you and me."
"I can't even open a magazine without thinking, thighs, thighs, thighs."
I'll take your thighs and raise you a chin.
I'll take your chin and raise you a
I happen to love the way I look.
I do not believe in plastic surgery.
I find it fascinating that four beautiful flesh and blood women could be intimidated by some unreal fantasy.
Is this really intimidating to any of you?
"If models could cause otherwise rational individuals to crumble in their presence, exactly how powerful was beauty?"
There are two types of guys that fall for beautiful women.
Either they're slime balls that are just out to get laid or they fall in love with you instantly.
Why fuck the girl in the skirt if you can fuck the girl in the ad for the skirt?
Being beautiful is such a power.
You can get whatever you want.
"I've been off ered trips to Aspen, weekends in Paris Christmas in St."
It's not like models don't have brains.
They just don't need to use them.
"Most guys just think you're dumb, but I'm really very literary."
I'll sit down and read a whole magazine from cover to cover.
Some scuba gear a Herb Ritt's photo.
"A Bulgari necklace, a breast job."
"Other times I think, Hey, I'm fucking a model."
Models are a lot looser than you think.
It's way easier to screw a model than a regular girl 'cause that's what they do all the time.
It's how regular people are when they're on vacation.
"Barkley, a notorious modelizer was one of those SoHo wonders who maintained a fabulous lifestyle despite never having sold a single painting."
So you're saying it's easy to meet them?
"The trick is, you gotta treat them like they're regular girls."
"You gotta be able to roll into a place, walk up to the hottest thing there."
It's kind of like being around dogs.
And that's what my life's about.
I want to show you something.
This is my real art only I can't really show it to the public.
The man had slept with half the perfume ads in September's Vogue.
"She does runway now, but I think she's gonna be huge someday."
I didn't know what to say.
There really wasn't anything to say except Do you have a light?
Later that day I was relieved to discover that at least one eligible bachelor got his kicks off the runway.
So I totally dig your friend Miranda.
"Yeah, I think she is so sexy and smart and Did she tell you that we made out?"
"I did, like a hundred times."
She totally won't return my phone calls.
Did she say anything about me?
"I don't know, maybe she's just busy."
Am I not cute enough for her?
I wanna see if I still have a chance.
"Right now, in front of you?"
I'm in the street with Carrie.
I just told her how you won't call me back.
So now you have to call me back.
"But seriously, I hope you call me back and did I mention this was Skipper?"
I believe there is a curse put on the head of anybody who tries to fix up their friends.
Where better to find modelizers in their natural habitat than a fashion show?
"Luckily, my friend Stanf ord Blatch had a client in the hottest show in town."
The Bone is like the human equivalent of the sable coat.
He's so beautiful that I find that sometimes I have to look away.
It's like he travels with his own personal lighting director.
The Bone was the world's biggest underwear model and Stanf ord's most important client as well as the subject of his single minded obsession.
"Derek, I would like you to meet a very dear friend, Carrie Bradshaw."
Carrie writes Sex And The City.
"The other day, Derek and I were walking past his billboard and he told me he'd like to get a piece of it for his apartment Iike maybe his nose."
"And I said, You should get the bulge in your pants."
"That way when women ask how big you are, you can say, 'Fourteen feet'."
"That would be funny, wouldn't it?"
Have I told you that enough?
We'd better let you get dressed.
We'll see you after the show.
Can you believe anyone that beautiful can be that nice?
"I keep dreaming that someday he's gonna say, Stanford, I love you."
How could anyone that gorgeous be straight?
Samantha Jones never missed a major fashion show.She was one of the only people I knew who thought that proximity to beauty made her feel more attractive.
You couldn't find seats right on the runway?
"Oh, you can see all the flaws from this angle."
You going to the party afterwards?
Martini straight up or with a twist?
Is he dating any one model in particular?
"Actually, he's sleeping with all of them in general."
Later that night we all went downtown f or a party.
I was beginning to float away on a sea of sweet potato puffs with smoked salmon and sour cream when It was Mr.
"Big: major tycoon major dream boat, and majorly out of my league."
I thought I saw you on the runway.
I started reading your column after we met.
What are you writing about this week?
"Well, I'm working on a story about menwho date models."
Only that they're very lucky.So what have you discovered about these men who are dating models?
"Well, I'm discovering that some of them treat it as a competitive sport and others I think just need the validation."
And probably others just have a thing for exceptionally beautiful women.
And there's something wrong with that?
I just think it might become a bit monotonous.
So where do you Where do you write these stories?
Have you got an office or anything?
"My cute stories?About half the time I'm at my apartment, and the other half I'm over at this coffee shop on d and Madison."
"Oh, Carrie, I'd like you to meet Misha."
You were great in the show.
Suddenly I felt like I was wearing patchouli in a room full of Chanel.
"Well, it was nice talking to you."
"See you around sometime, I hope."
I thought I had come to terms with my looks the year I turned when I realized that I no longer had the energy to be completely superficial.
"Your friend Barkley, he's really been coming on to me."
Do you actually think he believes I'm a model?
You don't want to go there.
He has this thing for secretly taping his conquests.
As Samantha began to get ready for her close up I felt it was time to call it a night.
I had never felt so invisible in my entire life.
"No, he's in there giving a neck massage to a Versace model."
"So, where are you going now?"
You wanna come home with me?
"Sure, if it's quiet.I can't take these crowds."
The things you gotta do in the name of research.
Shouldn't you be spending the night with some girl from the show?
"No, I never date models.I think they're stupid."
I wondered if there wasn't some kind of physics for beauty.
Maybe models could only be attracted to ordinary humans.
"So, I think it's so cool that you write."
"I've got intense thoughts, but I can't keep them in my head long enough to get them down on paper."
"The truth is, I'm totally neurotic."
"One minute I can be walking down the street, totally cool and the next minute I'm depressed for no reason."
"Before I say something, I say it in my head first so it doesn't come out wrong."
Doesn't that seem like a waste of time?
It only takes a second. And sometimes I get so distracted.
But I think it depends on my hair.
So what do you want to be when you grow up?
"Well, I think this might be it."
What do you want to be when you grow up?
I'd like to move back to lowa and have kids and be a cop.
I felt like I was in my bedroom when I was and I used to hang out with this guy who was really beautiful and my parents thought I was helping him with his chemistry homework.
Do you mind if we just lie here?
I get so lonely in the city.
Sometimes it's just nice to lie with someone.
It was hard to imagine that anyone so beautiful could ever be lonely.
"Meanwhile, somewhere below h Street two ordinary joes were doing their own lonely late night thing."
"So like, how come you haven't been returning any of my calls?"
It's been a really busy week.
I thought we had a connection.
"No, it's just It's got nothing to do with age."
You get that way with every guy that you're with?
Don't you wanna go out with a girl your own age?
Miranda couldn't resist the vision of herself reflected in Skipper's slightly smudged lenses.
"All right, let's get out of here."
Let me just pay f or my Cap'n Crunch.
And Samantha found the ultimate validation: sex with Barkley.
Your friend Carrie tell you about that?
Samantha demanded nothing less than the same consideration given every other model in town.
Do you have any idea what happened to Derek last night?
"Actually you'll never believe it, but Yes?"
Could you put Carrie back on the phone?
It's amazing what you'll do to be with these models.
"They keep me from getting work done, they make me fuck up my life."
I began to realize that being beautiful is like having a rent controlled apartment overlooking the park: completely unfair and usually bestowed upon those who deserve it least.
"I'm not interrupting your work, am l?"
But I've been thinking about your article about men who date models.
"First of all, there are so many goddamn gorgeous women in this city."
After a while you just wanna be with the one that makes you laugh.
Beauty is fleeting but a rent controlled apartment overlooking the park is forever.
One of the best things about living in a city like New York is leaving it.
My friend Patience and her husband invited me to the Hamptons for the weekend.
Patience and Peter were the perfect married couple.
"They were fun, smart and they looked like they fell out of a J."
"If their house wasn't right on the beach, I would have hated them."
So he gets in the cab and slides up next to me.
It is hot all the way from Houston and West Broadway to d and Madison.
Hampton houseguests are always required to sing for their supper.
Single people give married friends tidbits from their sexual escapades.
The next morning I woke up feeling rested and fabulous.
I couldn't wait to go out and take in the spectacular view.
MorningPatience went out to get juice and muffins.
There he was full frontal friend.
"He just stood there, casual, happy, hanging out."
I didn't know what to do or say.
I only knew one thing that's way too much Peter before coffee.
Got some fresh juice and the good muffins.
I ran into Peter in the hallway without his underwear on.
"Honey, did Carrie see your dick in the hall?"
"Yeah, she caught me on the way to the bathroom."
On the way to the bathroom.
So what are we doing today?
I barely had time to shove a good muffin in my purse before I was on my way back to New York.
Did he want to have sex with you?
Maybe we wanted to show it off.
Would you like some fresh pepper?
"Oh, honey, I'd love some fresh pepper."
"In fact, I think everyone at this table could use a lot of fresh pepper."
So I told her I didn't understand why she was so upset.
She said I couldn't understand it.
Single women prowl beach houses hoping for glimpses of their friends' husbands' dicks?
How good a friend was she?
"When someone gets married, all bets are off."
"They become married, and we become the enemy."
As the only single lawyer working at her law firm Miranda had given this topic some thought.
"Married women are threatened because we can have sex anytime, anywhere with anyone."
"And they're afraid we're gonna have it anytime, anywhere with their husbands."
I would never sleep with a married man.
What makes you so sure you haven't?
"Wedding rings come off, you know."
"If you're still single, you are not to be trusted."
Not all married women feel that way.
Charlotte treated marriage like a sorority she was hoping to pledge.
The ones who don't fear you pity you.
Are you telling me you haven't gotten those poor single you Iooks?
I hate it when you're the only single person at a dinner party and they all look at you like you're a Loser.
"I'm telling you, married people are the enemy."
Is there a secret cold war between marrieds and singles?
But now that I'm married I don't see them as much as I used to.
They remind me of how desperate I used to be.
"When women get married, they forget who they are."
My best buddy and I did everything together.
Then he married this girl who doesn't like me.
Now I only see him on Super Bowl Sunday.
It's all about what you want out of life.
"Some people, like me, choose to grow up face reality and get married."
"Live an empty, haunted life of stunted adolescence."
"No, it's not a cold war."
It's an out and out battle.
And it isn't just straight people.
"Every gay guy I know is running off to Hawaii putting on a caftan, reciting vows and feeling superior to me."
I miss the old times when everyone was alone.
Now I'm starting to feel like I'm an outcast in the outcasts.
I haven't seen you since you were Straight?
I was gonna say in Miss Saigon.
"Oh, this is my friend Stanford."
This is my life partner Lou.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Lou and I want to have a child.
"We already have a surrogate, but we need a topnotch egg."
What are your feelings about donating one?
"You think about it, and give us a call."
I had just experienced single bashing for the new millennium.
I was no longer considered a person.
I was now an egg farm.
"Meanwhile, in a park downtown another single woman was about to be humiliated."
Miranda was obliged to attend her firm's annual softball game.
"A law firm softball game is like any other except when a lawyer steals a base, he gets promoted."
I was afraid you wouldn't come.
Panicked at the idea of spending another firm function labeled as a leper Miranda had agreed to be fixed up on a blind date.
I'm gonna get us a soda.
Can I pick 'em or what?
I've been with the firm eight months.
I haven't once seen you with a guy.
When did being single translate into being gay?
"You want me to go over there No, I'll do it."
Brave Miranda marched right over and told Syd she wasn't.
They had a good laugh and decided to stay and play ball.
Miranda and Syd's last inning double play got the attention of everyone even the firm's senior partner.
"That was quite a play, ladies."
My wife and I are having a dinner party on the h.
We'd love it if you both could make it.
"Later that night, Miranda gave me the lowdown on her day."
So you think it's just because they think you're in a couple?
I've been with the firm for two years.
"All of a sudden, it's Chip."
And they seemed so relieved to have finally figured me out.
So you're going to the dinner?
I'm determined to make partner in this firm even if I have to be a lesbian partner.
"After Miranda left, I had a thought."
Maybe the cold war isn't about hate.
"Maybe it's about fear, fear of the unknown."
They just want us figured out.
I felt it was time to stop all the speculation and infiltrate the enemy camp.
"Lunch with my favorite couple, David and Lisa."
"Well, I don't think of us as married so much as together."
Remember that day you wore the white dress and we got all the flatware?
I guess I should stop seeing other men.
Then there are the other times.
Like family functions when you're the only one that's not married and they sit you at the kid's table.
"Or when you two eat off the same fork, I just Oh, man, that's so sweet."
"But you do want to get married someday, right?"
I'm beginning to think I may not be the marrying kind.
No sooner had the words come out of my mouth than I wondered if they were true.
We just about to have dessert.
Another time I hate being single is when married friends surprise fix you up.
Two espressos and a tiramisu later I had learned that Sean was the youngest of three brothers had his own investment firm and was about to move into an apartment he had just purchased.
"You know this was a fix up, right?"
"Oh, please.I could smell it before you walked in the door."
My parents met on a fix up and they will be married Wow.
It was then I realized I was having coffee with the marrying guy.
That elusive and rare Manhattan man whose sights were set on marriage.
"So, Carrie, can I see you again?"
"Over the next week and a half, I met Sean for a movie I met him for another movie and I helped him pick out a top of the line cheese grater at Williams Sonoma."
My buddies are giving me a big housewarming on the h.
You should come and bring your friends.
He was like the flesh and blood equivalent of a DKNY dress.
"You know it's not your style, but it's right there so you try it on anyway."
It was the night of the h.
On the East Side a pseudo lesbian couple attended a right wing Republican dinner party.
"On the West Side, a trio of single gals went to a single guy's housewarming party."
How did you manage to get a new boyfriend in a week?
He's just somebody I'm trying on.
"Everywhere I looked, people were standing in twos."
It was like Noah's Upper West Side rent controlled ark.
Samantha gave me a look like I had sold her to the enemy for chocolate bars and nylons.
And you have to be Samantha.
I've been planning it for years.
I'll give you the grand tour.
"As I moved through the married couples, I noticed something was different."
"No fear, no pity, no pointing."
Were Sean's friends cold war conscientious objectors or was it just that I was figured out ?
My accountant says that it's best to go with low risk stocks.
"Honey, I need you to come over here and meet someone."
"Honey, I really need you in the other room."
"It was nice talking to you, Samantha."
"Oh, you have one of these leather club chairs."
I'm using this room as an office now but someday this is gonna be the kid's room.
I got this three years ago in Aspen.
I didn't know that all his buddies were gonna be married.
You see that buddy over there?
I never thought I'd see them again.
Maybe we should start tagging your married men and that way you can keep track of them.
He's gonna ask you to marry him.
I've been dating him a week and a half.
No guy buys a classic six on the Upper West Side unless they are seriously thinking about marriage.
If you turn into one of those married assholes I'll kill you.
"Sean is the greatest guy, and he love kids."
"Plus, he owns his own business, and he's got in the bank."
"We both slept with him, and he is great in bed."
An hour and a half into this housewarming I had gone from party guest to prisoner of war.
I've gotta get her out of here.
You're not going anywhere without me.
"Last time I saw Patience, she was shoving me on a bus."
"When Sean told us you and he were dating, we were so thrilled."
About what happened at your beach house Don't mention it.
I just I'm not even sure I said don't mention it.
"This is my friend Patience, and this is her husband Peter."
"And just as suddenly, our little cease fire was over."
"Meanwhile, across town things were winding down."
We really had a great time.
"I'll meet you at the elevator, okay?"
I need to We can't do it again soon.
Syd and I aren't really a couple.
"In fact, we're not even really lesbians."
I just took advantage of the situation to bend your ear about my work at the firm.
She was looking to add a lesbian couple to our circle.
As they rode between floors Miranda considered how much easier her life would be if she were in a couple.
While Miranda cursed her heterosexuality and wondered how much longer she could fight the war Charlotte cursed tequila and forced Samantha into a cab.
She decided Samantha was too drunk to get home alone and insisted she spend the night on her couch.
Let me get that door for you.
She got Samantha upstairs and safely to bed.
"A couple of hours later, Samantha woke up still drunk and still single."
And single to Samantha meant one thing.
"Why don't you come upstairs, just for a minute?"
But I've been so lonely since I left home and I wanted the feel of a woman's touch on me.
"I'm going into the bathroom now and when I come out, you won't be here."
And I never want this mentioned again.
"Let me get the door for you, miss."
I was hoping you'd stay over.
"Look, Sean I don't think this is gonna work."
You obviously want to get married and I don't know what I want.
"You could smell my desperation, right?"
It's just I was trying you on.
All I hear is I want to get married.
And none of you says yes.
I'm so tired of going through women.
I just want to get married.
I may know someone who's perfect for you.
"They started out casual a brunch here, a concert there."
But pretty soon they were visiting china.
I always wanted this pattern for formal dining.
Charlotte broke it off then and there.
He was American Classic; she was French Country.
Your friend never called like she promised.
As I sifted through the rubble of my marriage skirmish I had a thought.
Maybe the fight between marrieds and singles is like the war in Northern lreland.
We're all basically the same but somehow we wound up on different sides.
"Sure, it'd be great to have that one special person to walk home with but sometimes there's nothing better than meeting your single girlfriends for a night at the movies."
Once upon a time in a kingdom far away a certain man and a slightly less certain woman kept bumping into one another.
It was almost as if they were dating accidentally.
"And then, after another chance meeting at a wealthy lawyer's new son's Bris they decided to pick a time to bump into each other on purpose."
The hottest new restaurant in Manhattan.
"He had her big three: Iooks, manners, money."
Did I tell you he wants to buy a painting from my gallery?
"He said, Meet me Meet me for a drink thing."
He never used the D word.
"I mean, thing comes before date."
I don't know how you can date that younger guy.
"Here, will you listen to this and tell me if you can figure out whether he's not meeting me as a date or as a friend."
"Sometimes you need a second opinion with doctors, real estate, men."
And I finished first in my litigation class.
How pathetic do I feel asking you if a guy kind of likes me?
"Carrie, Miranda this is the hottest chef in New York, Jon."
"His blue crab strudel was so fabulous, he didn't need one."
And this is his very cute friend Sam.
Can I get you a drink?
"No problem, 'cause the bartender's a buddy of mine."
Twenty something guys always know the really important B people.
Did I mention I'm sleeping with him?
"They stopped making martinis, so I got us two rum and Cokes."
"Well, I hate rum and I hate Coke.But thanks."
I was a waiter at TGIF.
Can you narrow that down a little bit?
I've been looking all over for you.
"Here you are, holding a tongue."
"Well, your message said you weren't coming."
I thought I said I'd try to make it for an hour.
"Yeah, but then you said that What did I say?"
"You're here, you have an hour."
I was outside trying to get in for minutes inside looking for you for leaving me with just enough time to tell you that I'm out of time.
"Men in their are like the New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle: tricky, complicated and you're never really sure you've got the right answer."
Do you want to get out of here?
"A short cab ride later Samantha, Jon no H , Sam and l found ourselves at the nearby twenty something club."
I can't believe you made Jon leave his own opening.
He is way too happening to be seen someplace borderline tired.
Hot places had the life span of a medfly.
"Samantha, everybody in here is in their ."
"As I glanced around the room, I was amazed at the wide variety of great twenty something guys."
"I'm not too heavy, am l?"
As we took a swig from our pony necked beers I remembered another type of twenty something guy.
"So, what's it like to kiss with that thing in?"
I have been fucked every way you can be fucked.
"If you keep talking like that, I'm gonna charge you by the minute."
"As I searched for my morning Marlboro Light Samantha proceeded to give me a rundown of her night with Jon no H, no inhibitions."
"We did it with him on top, me on top, me on my side."
"On his back, on his side, on his face."
"These guys in their twenties, they are up for anything."
How did it go with you and Sam?
"We just kissed for five hours at the club, in front of the club, on the corner of the club."
"I forgot how much fun it is to just kiss, you know even if I did only get two hours sleep."
As Samantha went on about her sexual escapades I glanced down at my arm.
There it was in Bic blue twenty something Sam's phone number.
"I had this sudden urge to call, but I'd just left him."
"Hell, my lips were still swollen."
Are men in their twenties the new designer drug?
"Yes, Samantha, Miranda and I were all recreational users but were we getting into something we couldn't handle?"
"Okay, we were attracted to younger men for various reasons."
But I couldn't help but wonder: What do they see in us?
Women in their thirties are just so grateful.
It's like every bullshit nice thing you do is like throwing food to the starving.
They give great head and know a lot about wine.
They remind me of my mom.
"They know who they are and what they want, and I like that."
"Later that week, Miranda and I compared notes."
Shouldn't we be dating men our own age?
There are no available men in their thirties in New York.
Giuliani had them removed along with the homeless.
Then what's really going on here?
ls it younger men feel safer?
What's really going on here is sex.
"Good old fashioned, eager to please do what l tell you to, Eagle Scout sex."
It's not like we're throwing out our schedules or anything.
I'm late for a meeting with my editor.
I didn't wanna tell her I cancelled lunch with my editor to go to Banana Republic and help twenty something Sam pick out a shirt.
"As I helped him try them on, I thought He's sweet, he's fun, and I think he likes me."
Could he be more than a fling?
Could he be a potential boyfriend?
"And speaking of potential boyfriends Iater that week the crossword puzzle asked me to meet him for a drink, blank."
"Not quite a date, five letters, starts with a T ."
"Whoever this is, I can't talk."
I'm late for a drink thing.
I'm meeting Brian later and don't know what to do.
"Well, last night after a movie, we're walking down Second Avenue and just passed Four minutes, Charlotte."
I can't just blurt out what he asked me.
What did the perfect boyfriend ask?
Meet me in front of your apartment in ten minutes.
Tell me exactly how he worded it.
We've been seeing each other for a couple of weeks.
And tomorrow night after dinner I want us to have anal sex.
"Okay, next stop is gonna be d and Madison?"
And then we're picking up Samantha.
"You need all the girl support you can get, and I'm late for drinks with Big."
"Even in her state of abject blackness, Charlotte was a dating optimist."
How much do you like him?
Dating a few months until somebody better comes along a lot or marrying and moving to East Hampton a lot?
"Well, you better get sure real quick."
"If he goes up there, there's gonna be a shift in power."
Either he'll have the upper hand or you will.
There's a certain camp that believes whoever holds the dick holds the power.
"The question is if he goes up your butt, will he respect you more or less?"
"Sir, we're talking up the butt."
You could use a little back door.
All I'm saying is that this is a physical expression that the body was designed to experience.
"Look, I'm just saying, with the right guy and right lubricant What was that?"
Bitch is getting everything the first bitch didn't.
"There he was, right in the middle of my drink thing Mr."
I'm gonna go ask her to join us for dinner.
Why don't you two have a guy's night.
"You know, talk, cry, shoot bear."
I'm way behind on my column anyway.
We'll do our thing another time.
I didn't know what I was supposed to feel.
I decided to walk to clear my head.
"Also, I just left my cab fare on the table."
I walked blocks in four hundred dollar shoes.
I just needed something to take the edge off.
A little kiss to make me feel better.
I wasn't getting the same rush.
"Meanwhile uptown, Charlotte wondered when relationships had gotten so complicated."
"She yearned for the time when dinner was followed by dessert, not lubricant."
"I want to, but I can't."
"I mean, actually No, that's not true."
"I don't know what I want, but I'm afraid if I don't you'll dump me."
"And if I do, then I'll be the up the butt girl."
I don't wanna be the up the butt girl.
Men don't marry the up the butt girl.
I want children and nice bedding and I just can't handle this right now.
Can we fuck the regular way?
"That night, they made love the Charlotte way polite and respectful on count Egyptian cotton sheets."
Meanwhile downtown That was really great.
You know when you lay like that you have the cutest little wrinkles in your neck.
Samantha realized as long as she dated someone younger she would always be older.
She gave up twenty somethings right then and there.
As Samantha went cold turkey I got in deeper and deeper.
"Who cares about age, crossword puzzles the cab money I'd left on the table?"
"This felt so good, I'd do anything to keep this high."
And just when I thought I couldn't get any higher he spooned me.
"I woke up wanting more, or maybe not."
"In the gray morning light, everything looked completely different."
"Candles from Urban Outfitter, dirty laundry, a pizza box."
I'm in a twenty something apartment.
"My father and my ex girlfriend were, like, dead or something."
"And I had these big hands, like big aluminum hands."
"And I lived in this, like, big missile silo that was totally nuclear, and it was surrounded by, like, my enemies and shit."
"And one by one, they'd run at me"
"I don't remember, but they would, like, run at me and I would crush them to pieces with my big aluminum hands."
He had no face and stuff but I crushed him.
"I could crush anything with these big fucking hands, man."
You don't have any coffee You don't have any coffee filters.
You were in the dream as this beautiful unicorn woman with glass eyes.
"That would make a kick ass song, wouldn't it?"
Every fiber in my thirty something being was screaming Get out
And just when I thought I couldn't sink any lower I need toilet paper
I'm just using the last of it to make the coffee.
I decided the only way to break free was to move from one addiction to an even bigger one.
A couple of blocks and way too much money later I realized I had just entered an interesting chapter in my life.
I had outgrown the boys of my past and not quite grown into the men of my future.
Why is it in a city of ten million men you always see the one you don't want and never see the one you What are you doing down there?
It's a wobbly table.Guess I have the touch.
Would you care to join us?
"Hey, just so you know, I would've gotten hinge on my own."
"Now that I've got Jack hooked up, I'm single again."
Maybe we could have dinner sometime.
I'm just not so good at people puzzles.
"As I walked away, I had a thought: Maybe all men are a drug."
"Sometimes they bring you down and sometimes, like now, they get you so high."
It would've been so cool if I hadn't looked back.
The most powerful woman in New York is not Tina Brown or Diane Sawyer or even Rosie O'Donnell.
It's the hostess at Balzac which had overnight become the only restaurant that mattered.
And we were there to celebrate the moment.
We've been waiting f or minutes.
I think I'm gonna f aint.
Doesn't she know who we are?
I own my own PR firm.You write a newspaper column.
"Look, I'm not sure you understand but I'm kind of somebody and she's definitely kind of somebody and we really need to eat now."
Do you think I should make it a
"If I had with me, do you think I'd give it to that girl?"
She cannot do this to us.
I was that woman ten years ago but I wielded my power in a benevolent manner.
Can we please talk about this over lunch somewhere else?
"Where, somewhere like New Jersey, where we might actually get seated?"
"Do you realize, if she were a man, not only would we be eating now but they'd be sending over free drinks."
I know a great Thai place around the corner where the owner's son practically always sends over a complementary order of mee krob.
Do you think we can get it to go?
"A short time later, Samantha headed back to her office while I decided to investigate this theory I had about shopping as a way"
"A short time later, Samantha headed back to her office while I decided to investigate this theory I had about shopping as a way to unleash the creative subconscious."
I was already planning on returning them when
They told me to do that.
And now they want to talk to you.
When did you get to town?
I can't let you do this.
And you can pay me back never.
When did you two About two months.
His family has this gigantic ranch in Argentina.
"He has a tiny little penis, but he knows exactly how to use it."
"That's very nice of you, but I just can't accept these."
When have I ever given you a birthday present or a Christmas present?
"I mean, you are like a sister to me yet I never see you."
"The truth was, we'd only met a f ew times."
Most people would classify Amalita as Eurotrash.
I'm staying at the Four Seasons with Carlo.
Don't you live in the city?
I'm a citizen of the world.
"A citizen of the world, darling."
"Now take the shoes, and we'll talk soon."
I couldn't understand a word she was saying but I f elt I had in my possession all the ltalian I'd ever need to know.
"While at home, all the English I seemed to encounter was bills, bills, bills."
"Her lif e was a blur of rich men, designer clothes and glamorous resorts."
"She didn't actually work f or a living, yet possessed a dazzling sexual power that she exploited to her full advantage."
Where's the line between prof essional girlfriend and just plain prof essional?
Women have the right to use every means at their disposal to achieve power.
Short of sleeping their way to the top.
Not if that's what it takes to compete.
Of men which is perf ectly legal.
In an eff ort to save money and maybe even pick up a f ew extra bucks I invited the girls over f or poker.
So you advocate a double standard.
Women can use their sexuality to get ahead whenever possible but men should not be allowed to take advantage of it?
I'm just saying that men and women are equal opportunity exploiters.
What if you sense that someone is giving you a prof essional advantage because they find you charming?
"A f ew days ago, Neville Morgan, the notoriously reclusive painter paid a visit to the gallery."
Neville was making his yearly pilgrimage to Manhattan to check out what was new and hot on the art scene.
And he f ound it Charlotte.
It was only a matter of moments bef ore he invited her to his f arm upstate to view his latest work.
"If I could get him to show at the gallery, it would be an incredible coup."
"But what if he wants me to, you know."
If he so much as suggests what she's suggesting you give me a call and we'll sue the hell out of him.
That's the only proper way to trade sex f or power.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
You're like the Harvard Law Lorena Bobbitt.
I told him I was here.
"He insisted on picking me up, but he's not supposed to be here till"
He's like a sweet little seal pup.
That you sometimes want to club.
I can wait in the hall.
You guys have cleaned me out.
"A couple of hours later, I was looking f orward to calling it an early night, when"
I'm getting ready to go to sleep.
Why don't you come and join us?
"We are at Balzac, and there is someone here I am dying f or you to meet."
"I'd love to, but I'm really trying to cut back."
"You know, pinch a f ew pennies."
"You are crazy, you know that?"
Why don't you just come down here and be your f abulous self?
The truth was I could barely aff ord that either.
But I rationalized that my new shoes shouldn't be punished just because I can't budget.
"Darling, what took you so long?"
You won't believe what Carlo bought me this afternoon at Van Cleef Arpels.
"Listen, I want you to come and meet the world's most f abulous man."
Sounds like a trendy sideshow act.
"Carrie, I'd like you to meet my boyfriend Carlo."
Gilles is an architect from Paris.
How long are you here f or?
I've told Gilles all about you.
I told him you were the most beautiful talented and f ascinating woman in New York.
You're an architect and a comedian.
I'm just being un peu stupide.
I suddenly recalled my terrible weakness f or gorgeous French architects.
Can I get anyone something else?
You would like another bottle of wine?
And what will the rest of you be having?
"During the next couple of hours, I put my journalistic skills to good use."
"I discovered that Gilles was recently divorced with a five year old daughter, Beatrice who lived with her mother in Paris."
He was passing through New York on his way to Brazil to supervise construction of a new hotel.
I think you are too beautiful to be a writer.
I think you're too charming to be an architect.
I think you should give up your lif e here and move with me to Paris immediately.
I thought you were spending the next six months in Brazil.
You can join me there first.
I'm so broke these days I might take you up on that off er just to save on rent.
"It's just, I have this little substance abuse problem."
I'm only here f or the weekend but I would love to see you tomorrow.
Maybe you could show me the town.
You've never been to New York?
About times but I've never seen it with someone like you.
"You really have that certain je ne sais quoi, don't you?"
"Sure, I saw some red flags divorced, French and almost uncomf ortably handsome but I f elt like I was floating on air."
"The next morning I was brought back down to Earth as I confronted that eternal puzzle a closet full of clothes, nothing to wear."
And I know that I shouldn't be because I can sense that it's totally turning her off.
It's like she's got this power over me and I'm helpless.
"I have to get dressed, all right?"
Is it possible to be addicted to a person?
"The sex is so awesome that it's, like it's all I can think about."
I've never considered myself a horn dog bef ore but I'm worried I might be starting to scare her off.
"Well, is that what she said?"
"No, but mostly we just have sex in the afternoon."
She never lets me spend the night.
Why don't the two of you just spend a night together and not have sex?
"Well, I think it's really important that you try."
I like to spend the whole day smelling like Miranda.
I began to f ear that Miranda's sexuality was overpowering poor Skipper.
Later I spent the most incredibly romantic afternoon with Gilles.
I f elt like I had landed in a Claude Lelouch film A Man and a Slightly Neurotic Woman.
I kind of have this rule.
I don't sleep with men I've only known a day.
"After all, it was already tomorrow in Paris."
You look so beautiful when you sleep.
I didn't want to disturb you.
"As he walked out the door, it suddenly dawned on me that he didn't have my phone number."
And I didn't have his phone number.
But he had left me a note with in cash.
Thanks f or the beautiful day.
Must have been a hell of a beautiful day.
We had such a f antastic connection.
What exactly about me screams whore ?
I just can't believe that you had dinner at Balzac.
Besides the on the end table?
I thought I ordered two eggs benedict and one spinach omelette.
"We're gonna pay f or all this ourselves, all right?"
"The room service is one thing, but the money uh uh."
What are you getting so uptight about?
"Theref ore, getting money f or sex is simply an exchange of power."
Don't listen to the dime store Camille Paglia.
I don't know whether to take it as an incredible compliment or as an incredible insult.
I wouldn't know how to return it anyway because he didn't leave me his number.
What more is there to talk about?
"Who is this Amalita Amalfi character, anyway?"
I'm concerned that you've been drafted into a ring of high class hookers.
She's She's like an international party girl.
She's a hooker with a passport.
Do you ever have any conversations about money?
I did allude to the f act that I was a bit cash poor these days.
So maybe it's supposed to be a loan?
I don't remember filling out an application.
Do you really want to say that?
That's the argument men have used since the dawn of time to exploit women.
I'm just gonna write the whole thing off as a bad date with a cash bonus.
"You know, that salmon is really good."
I think we should order another one.
As I struggled with the dilemma of how to manage my newf ound money Charlotte arrived at the secluded Connecticut home of the painter Neville Morgan in an attempt to secure his latest work.
Meeting you is without a doubt the high point of my career.
I'm frankly surprised that someone as young as you is even familiar with my work.
The canvasses you're about to see are what I consider to be the apotheosis of every great idea I've ever had.
"It's the closest I've ever come to pure, universal God f orce."
The most powerful f orce in the universe.
The source of all lif e and pleasure and beauty.
I used to paint full nudes but as I got older I realized that the truth was to be f ound only in the cunt.
But Neville Morgan was not a man to be corrected.
I thought you might like something to drink.
"Charlotte, this is my wif e, Gertrude."
Each of these portraits is of a woman who has touched my lif e.
I wonder would you consider posing f or me sometime?
"So long as you're here, I could sketch you this afternoon."
"I bet you have a beautiful cunt, dear."
As Charlotte pondered how f ar she would go f or her love of art and the gallery Another Saturday night.
With my hooker money still burning a hole in my pocket Samantha and I showed up at Balzac.
She reasoned that since I was there once I was as good as in.
"I made these reservations weeks ago, and she's already been here."
Is there a host that I might talk to?
"I will put her over my knee, and I will snap her like a twig."
"I'm going to go to the bathroom, and then we're leaving, all right?"
They all looked so chic and glamorous.
Part of me wanted to grab Samantha and make a run f or it.
"Carrie, I want you to meet Mario Allen, Justine and Peter."
Mario's f amily has one of those gorgeous palazzos on the Grand Canal in Venezia.
And we are all going there next week f or the film f estival.
"Yes, you must bring your little laptop and write all about it."
You'd be mad not to go.
Carrie is one of the most f ascinating talented and beautiful women in New York.
"Venice is the most beautiful, the most romantic city in the world."
That's why you must come immediately bef ore it's all gone.
I couldn't say I wasn't tempted.
I realized that I could leverage myself Iike the human equivalent of a sexy junk bond.
"I'd parlay that into a trip to Venice into a nice piece of jewelry a rich husband, f ollowed by a richer divorce."
I'm gonna have to say good bye.
She's waiting f or me at the bar.
I'm staying at the Carlyle with Peter.
Just because Venice was sinking didn't mean my morals had to go down with it.
And as f or Gilles and the I figured there was nothing to be done.
"For better or worse, I had just established my rate f or a one night stand."
And then the most powerful woman in Manhattan asked me f or a f avor.
"I never told Samantha the source of my newf ound power but from that moment on, we never had a problem getting a table at Balzac again."
"A couple of weeks later, we were all there to celebrate Charlotte's coup."
I am so not number nine.
They say a picture is worth a thousand words but in this case I was speechless.
"Two weeks ago, I had my picture taken."
It was a promotional photo for my column scheduled to run on the side of a bus.
I had misgivings which were somewhat mollified when they told me I could keep the dress.
"In lieu of any actual social life of their own Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte had all stopped by to live vicariously through my first official date with Mr."
"It's tits on toast, baby, but you make it work."
You're obviously gonna have sex tonight.
She's just gonna look like sex.
I thought you were serious about this guy.
You can't sleep with him on the first date.
Here she goes again with The Rules.
The women who wrote that book wrote it because they couldn't get laid so they constructed this whole bullshit theory to make women who can get laid feel bad.
"But if you're serious about a guy, then you have to keep him in a holding pattern for at least five dates."
Yes because the number of dates you wait to have sex with a man is directly proportional to your age.
"Just don't fuck on a first date, you're fine."
A guy can just as easily dump you if you fuck him on the first date as he can if you wait until the tenth.
When have you ever been on a tenth date?
"And by then, at least you're emotionally involved."
"I mean, isn't it better to find out if the sex is good right offthe bat before anybody's feelings get hurt?"
It's okay to have hurt feelings.
And you always handle those so well.
"Well, there is something to be said for restraint."
When did you become such a Victorian?
True romance cannot exist without good sex.
And yet you can have good sex with someone you don't like or respect or even remember.
"Well, ladies, I'm just going to dinner."
"The truth is, I was dying to sleep with him but isn't delayed gratification the definition of maturity?"
I'm perfectly capable of restraining myself.
I can't be hemmed in by rules.
Some of the greatest romances of all time began with sex on the first date.
I will not be the first one to speak.
"And if he never calls me again, I'll always think of him fondly as an asshole."
"That was really I mean, can you believe we on the first date?"
"I mean, I didn't plan that, you know?"
"I thought it was pretty fuckin' great, but what do I know?"
You feel like getting some Szechuan?
Big discovered my weakness for great sex and greasy Chinese?
Or was going out to dinner simply a diversionary tactic to keep me from spending the night?
Before I was able to completely indulge my paranoia it was my pal Mike Singer.
We've known each other for ten years but never had sex because we want to know each other f or another ten years.
I'm with I'll tell you later.
I'm an old friend of Mike's.
It's so nice to finally meet a friend.
I left the table wondering why Mike didn't want to introduce me to his date.
"That very same night, something absolutely amazing happened to Miranda."
I didn't mean Are you okay?
She met someone in gym class.
So what exactly about my head pissed you off?
I wish there was something I could do.
"Well, you can buy me dinner sometime and a CAT scan."
He was a sports medicine doctor with an apartment overlooking the Natural History Museum.
"Three prior serious relationships, none resulting in marriage."
"So, really, can I call you sometime?"
He left a message on my machine when I got home.
He wants to go out this week.
I think maybe that kick in his head scrambled his brains.
Too quick is sleeping with him on the first date.
"You both got excited, and you went for it."
"The dress led me on, had a lif e of its own."
"Then we went to this Chinese restaurant, and you'll never guess who I ran into."
Mike Singer out on a date.
"He was acting very weird, like he Iike he didn't want me to meet her."
"Mike told me everything that afternoon while I helped him pick out sheets at Bed, Bath Beyond."
So how long have you been seeing her?
A while.Is this a painful topic?
No.It's just she's not someone I date openly.
"The thing is, she's smart, incredibly sweet, and sex is great."
She's just not the one I see myself with.
It was about three months ago.
"Mike had been dumped by Fiona Brooks, a cellist for the Philharmonic who he was trying to forget as quickly as possible."
"They had both loved to cook, and shopping was a Saturday morning ritual."
So he was feeling particularly vulnerable when
Care to try some aged sheep's milk cheese from the Alps?
Fresh goat cheese from the Napa Valley.
It's a triple cream from France.
Since he didn't think Libby was that gorgeous there wasn't any pressure.
"The next morning, he woke up and felt at ease very relaxed."
I'm a creative director of an ad agency but eventually I'd love to have my own shop.
I'd love to have my own shop too.
She was one of the only women he'd ever met who he felt he could just be with.
.She's not beautiful and we don't have a lot in common.
"I mean, most of her friends are in dairy."
But she's warm and unpretentious and it was the best sex I've ever had in my life.
What are other people going to think?
All I know is that she's not the right woman for me in the larger sense so I keep her a secret.
I couldn't decide whether Mike was being shallow or honest but the question nagged me for days.
How many of us out there are having great sex with people we're ashamed to introduce to our friends?
Have I ever had fabulous sex with someone I didn't want to admit to?
Did I ever tell you about that jazz musician who lived with his mother?
The one who doesn't wear any underwear?
I met this gorgeous kid in Spy Bar last year.
He was He turned out to be in high school.
"Evidently, Samantha had had lots of sex none of which was secret."
It just proves that I'm not ashamed of anyone I've slept with.
There it was the dress that led me down the garden path with Mr.
"Besides, there's no such thing as bad publicity."
"You know, we need to go someplace absolutely fabulous where we can toast you where the bus goes by."
I haven't heard from him since we spent the night together.
You are going to be on the side of a bus.
Ten million men are going to be drooling over you on their way to work.
It's the best personal ad I've ever seen in my life.
Samantha had a particular knack for turning a desperate situation into a hopeless one.
Speaking of secret sex did Charlotte ever tell you about the rabbi?
I cannot believe the two of you came down here to interrogate me at work.
You know who I'm talking about.
He was a Hasidic folk artist from Brooklyn.
"Evidently, Charlotte had seen Shmuel's work in an exhibition and scheduled an appointment to meet him at his studio."
You have a beautiful way with light.
I wanted to capture the exuberance of youth.
Charlotte quickly became intoxicated by his talent his strangeness and the smell of his wool.
"It was so sexy, so forbidden."
Daddy's little Episcopalian princess in the arms of one of God's chosen people.
So we would talk about art and sex and the Torah.
Why didn't you introduce him to anybody?
"I was embarrassed.I mean, I could really date him, and he couldn't date me."
"I mean, what would people think?"
"Now, you cannot put this in your column."
"If the sex is good, who cares what anybody thinks?"
Was secret sex the ultimate form of intimacy since it existed in a pure state exempt from the judgment of the world?
Or is it just another way in which we deny our feelings and emotionally compartmentalize our lives?
"Well, at the risk of sounding trite I haven't been able to stop thinking about you."
We should have a real first date.
"Of course, knowing us, we'll skip the movie."
Just as long as we don't skip dinner.
I had just escaped the sex on the first date curse.
"That weekend, I was out with a man whose name I wanted to shout from the rooftops."
Your picture is going to be on a bus?
A crosstown bus or a downtown bus?
I'm getting together a group of my friends tomorrow afternoon to watch it go by.
I thought maybe if you weren't doing anything
Just some guy I skied with in Aspen.
Had I suddenly become the invisible woman?
I tried not to let it bother me.
I also tried not to let it bother me that he took me back to Fung Wa scene of our postcoital dinner.
"Oh, I can't make your party tomorrow."
I wanted to introduce you to some of my friends.
"Well, I'll be home later if you miss me."
As I surveyed the room I realized it smelled like a cheap date you don't want anyone to meet.
Big I was on a deadline and I had to get home.
"Of all the restaurants in Manhattan, why did you take Libby to Fung Wa?."
There's not much of a chance of running into anybody I know.
You mean it's the kind of place men take women they don't want to be seen with in public?
Was it possible that I had become Mr.
"The next morning, Miranda discovered a shocking sex secret of her own."
She had just spent a wonderful night with Ted who had to leave early in the morning to catch a flight to D.
Miranda waited for the dead bolt to drop and then used the opportunity to ransack Ted's apartment and look for pictures of old girlfriends.
She was not at all prepared for what she found.
Do you feel your cock where it wants to be every night?
"Every single night when you come home and everything's done in the house, and I've been doing it all day I don't know what to do."
I can't admit to having found this but now I don't know if I want to see him again.
How can you judge him till you spank him?
But obviously this is what he's into.
Maybe it's just his fantasy life.
"Later that day, the cream of New York gathered to toast the maiden voyage of my bus."
"What do you mean, he couldn't make it?"
But this is your bus party.
"I told you you shouldn't have Well, never mind."
He's not here because I slept with him on the first date?
When you sleep with a man on the first date the relationship will never be anything more than just sex.
I didn't want to admit she was right.
I just wanted to see my bus and get the hell out of there.
I thought you were going to bring Libby.
I finally ask her to join me in public; she turns me down.
She told me she met somebody else who doesn't have my problems with intimacy.
Nobody in New York notices a bus until it's about to him them.
"Meanwhile, Miranda spent another wonderful evening with Ted and began to reevaluate her options."
That was one of the most amazing meals I have ever had.
"You know, I missed you today."
I guess I've just been waiting all this time for a good kick in the head.
And here I thought that all you really wanted was a good spanking.
Ted didn't take Miranda home that night.
He never took her calls or returned her messages.
and she never saw him at the gym again.
"Very late that night, fueled by a massive quantity of champagne I decided to say good bye to Mr."
I just came here to tell you that if you're embarrassed or ashamed to be involved with me in any way that we can no longer see each other.
"The truth is, I blame myself."
I wore the naked dress on our first date.
I slept with him too f ast and now I'm on a Fifth Avenue bus with a penis on my head.
ou won't introduce me to your friends.
You bring me back to that restaurant where men take women they don't want to be seen with.
You won't come out and meet my friends.
You have me in a niche.
Like I'm only a particular fragment of the kind of person you think you should be dating.
But I've only gotten to know a particular fragment although I'm beginning to know more.
This is me reacting to your perception of me.
Well I think Fung Wa's is the best Chinese food in the city so that's why we went there.
"And the guy we met in the street, and I couldn't remember his name which possibly means I have Alzheimer's so that's what that was about."
"And this afternoon I had courtside tickets to the Knicks and that's all, folks."
"I should have been jumping f r joy, but I only felt a hard knot of fear."
So you and me then maybe this is for real?
The island of Manhattan is a cozy village populated by more than seven million fascinating individuals
who all behave like they own the sidewalk but lately it seemed as if the entire city had been magically reduced to only two people... us.
"Four hour conversations flew by in a space of fifteen minutes and a few days apart felt like weeks, I realized that Einstein's law of relativity would have to be amended to include a special set of rules, those to explain the peculiar effects of infatuation."
"Hi, I'm trying to get hold of a Miss Carrie Bradshaw; she used to be a friend of mine."
"Wait, I think I recognize that voice."
"God, I can't believe it's been that long, I've been meaning to call you."
"Well, yeah, that's the least of it."
"You know what, I don't think that I have been hit this hard since...nah you know what, I'm not going to compare it to anything else because everything else has always ended."
"So, will I actually get to see you sometime?"
"Alright, so I'll call Charlotte and Samantha and see if they're free, cause Big s got this dinner thing, so ya know, we didn t have any plans anyway"
"God, would you listen to yourself?"
"Yeah, I know, I've become one of those women we hate."
"Yes you have, I can't talk now, I'll call you later ok?"
"As I hung up, I realized I'd committed the cardinal sin."
I'd forsaken my girlfriends for my new boyfriend.
That night I faced the tribunal.
"Miranda had worked on a big successful merger Samantha was obsessed with the idea of a new apartment And Charlotte, Charlotte was practically engaged."
"They met the day after I dropped off the edge of the earth He's name was Michael Conway, he was from a good New York family and he absolutely adored Charlotte."
"I think this might be it, I think this might be the one."
"We ve met him, he's perfect."
Even his fucking dog is perfect.
"Last night after Michael took Charlotte to the Philharmonic, they went back to his place and began the classic dating ritual the blowjob tug of war."
Are telling us you never perform this act?
"She'll juggle, she'll spin plates, but she won't give head."
I don t like putting it in my mouth.
I have a very sensitive gag reflex and it makes me want to puke.
That's one way to say no.
It's not like I haven't tried practiced on a banana.
I pretended it was a popsicle but I just don t like it.
"Personally, I m loving it up to the point when the guy wants me to swallow."
"Well, that s just really a judgement call."
Some men just take it so personally if you don t.
Some guys don't give you a choice.
"Well, that s just bad behavior."
Are you honestly telling me you like it?
"Well, it s not my favorite thing on the menu but, you know, I ll order it from time to time."
"And, with the right guy, it can be nice."
Oral sex is like god's gift to women; you can get off without worrying about getting pregnant.
"Plus, the sense of power is such a turn on."
Maybe you re on your knees but you ve got him by the balls.
"Now, you see, that is the reason that I don t want to go down this road."
"Well, sweetheart if you re going to get all choked up about it just don t do it."
"But if you don't go down on him, how can you expect him to go down on you?"
"Oh well forget it, I only give head to get head."
"A few hours and a couple of bottles later, vows of friendship renewed, we were almost out the door when"
"Yeah, I m going to go over and say hi."
Ditching us now would be in really bad form.
I m not going to ditch you.
"Good, good I was just out here, with my posse having dinner and er I saw you."
"Oh, uhm, Carrie this is Julia Woods."
Can I talk to you for a second?
I thought you said you had a business thing tonight.
"Well, she s stunning and I should know because frankly, she stunned me."
I was just er You know I didn't realize you were dating other women.
"Well, not a lot of them."
Why don t we talk about this Saturday?
"So uhm then, enjoy your dinner."
Oh already said that enjoy it twice.
"I can't believe it, he's seeing other women"
"True, we had never discussed exclusivity."
"But while for me the idea of seeing another man would be like trying to fit another outfit into an already over stuffed suitcase, Big was happily dating another woman like it was the most natural thing in the world."
"Is it that men have an innate aversion to monogamy, or is it more than that?"
"I wondered in a city like New York, with it s infinite possibilities, has monogamy become too much to expect?"
I ve been involved in a monogamous relationship for over a year now.
"Of course, my definition of monogamy includes sex with prostitutes."
The problem with monogamy? it s just so incredibly dull
My lover and I have a kind of s monogamy.
We have sex with other people but we don t exchange fluids or phone numbers.
Monogamy is fabulous it gives you a deep and profound connection to another human being and you don t have to shave your legs as much.
This is the best in the building.
Have you ever seen any place like this?
"Excuse me, excuse me, was someone looking for a view?"
"Oh, Pamela it s beautiful but it s a little out of my price range."
"I know, I know, so sue me."
I just love to show the cr?me de la cr?me.
"I will break my ass for you, sweetheart."
I just want to ask you for one small favor in return.
I don t even want my own kids
Promise me that you won t work with any other broker.
"Samantha didn t believe in monogamy, especially when it came to Real Estate agents."
This is a pre war six.
"Notice the classic lines, very solidly built."
"Although Pamela had the hottest contacts in town, Rick did have a slight competitive edge."
He gave Samantha the opportunity to combine her two greatest loves Sex and Real Estate.
"That afternoon I dragged my poor, tortured soul out to lunch with Stanford Blach and attempted to stun it senseless with cosmopolitans."
Monogamy is on the way out again.
It had a brief comeback in the s but as the millennium approaches everyone s leaving their options open.
"Come on, you wouldn t commit to a nice guy given the option?"
I can t even commit to a long distance Carrier.
My book just got a kick ass review at Entertainment Weekly.
"Oh, Jared, have you met Carrie Bradshaw?"
"No, but I ve read your column."
You should write about me sometime.
My life s so fucked up right now.
"Oh Carrie, Jared is the writer of the book Avenue B ."
And New York magazine just named him one of the coolest people under in the city.
"You know, if they were doing the sexiest women under thirty, I m sure you d go right to the top of the list."
"You re quite the storyteller, aren t you?"
"Listen, the magazine s having a party tomorrow night at the Bruno I ll be sure to put your names at the door so, you ll be there?"
"I used to get a secret rush from men who hit on me during their fifteen minutes of fame, in this case it nearly felt exhausting."
I was just calling to confirm tomorrow night.
I was striving for not coming over but I was worried I had just bordered on shrill.
I ll pick you up at eight.
There were so many questions I wanted him to answer but would not ask.
"Not tonight at least, no, tonight I would ask Miranda."
"He said, I miss you baby."
Do you think that was meant to be some kind of coated mea culpa ?
"You mean like, what he really meant was I ve been a complete idiot please forgive me for having dinner with that other woman."
"Oh no, cause that would mean that everything he ever said that I interpreted as sincere, was said to interpretation."
In that case what I perceive as his feelings for me may only really be reflected rejections of my feelings for him.
"Hey guys, great to see you."
"Oh hey, Allison this is Miranda and Carrie."
"Hi, it s nice to meet you, I ve heard so much about you."
"You know, we re all such great big fans of your column over at Vogue."
Skipper and I just had the most incredible meal.
That I am telling you I lived a year in Paris and never ate so well and cheap.
Go quick before the times destroys it with the rain.
"Anyway, it s great to see you guys."
Who was that self important bitch?
I think that was Skipper s new girlfriend.
I didn t think that was his type.
"Well, that s true Miranda you re his type but you broke up with him, remember?"
"Something looks different, has he been working out?"
"Hey, Skipper here leave me a message."
"Hi Skipper, it s Miranda I just want to say it was great running into you today."
"You look great, did you do something different to your hair?"
I can t talk right now.
"I just wanted to say, maybe, I thought we could have dinner some night."
Allison I think you re great and Uhm but I gotta be totally honest with you.
The woman who I think I love just called and asked me back.
You re breaking up with me while you re still inside of me?
"As Skipper re dedicated his singular affection for Miranda, Charlotte was receiving her own declaration of monogamy."
What do you think about not seeing anyone else but each other?
That might be a good idea.
I think it s the best idea I ve ever had in my life.
And while Charlotte embraced fidelity and Samantha flaunted her infidelity.
I found myself caught somewhere in between.
"So, whose very part of the apartment."
"Max, he s an old friend of mine, now remember back in"
"Hi, love your column, never miss it."
I ve been trying to call you.
She s a friend I once travelled with.
"Let s find Max Hey, Max."
I m glad you could make it.
"Max, I want you meet someone very special."
"Carrie writes a fantastic column, it s called sex and the city."
"Well, if you re looking for material you re dating the right man."
I thought we were just sleeping together.
"I m sure tonight, we won t be doing much of either."
"Carrie, you ve got to be kidding."
How many women are you dating?
"Well, let s see there s me, Julia, oh, and let s not forget international Melissa"
I m not doing this Carrie.
Can t we just enjoy the party?
"Come on, what do you want from me?"
What do I want from you?
"Nothing, I don t want anything from you."
I felt like a fool I had gone so far out on a limb with my feelings that I didn t realize I was standing out there alone.
"When life gets this confusing, sometimes there s only one thing to do Attend a fabulous party."
I ll get you a drink.
"In a room where everyone was gorgeous, cool and under thirty monogamy suddenly began to seem like a quaint notion."
Don t you just want to lie like this forever?
I want you to know that that other woman doesn t mean a thing to me.
"That s alright, I don t mind if you keep seeing her."
I broke up with her the second that you called.
"Skipper, you didn t have to do that."
"Of course I did, I was so happy to hear from you we were still doing it while I was talking to you and I didn t even realize it."
"Yeah, that s exactly what it is, crazy."
"Listen, Skipper, I m not ready for a full blown relationship thing."
"I mean we could see each other and still see other people, right?"
Why did you call back anyway?
"I m not your private stud horse, you know, just Dial A Fuck."
"I m tired of being jerked around, I hope you find what you re looking for."
"While Miranda misjudged the intensity of Skipper s feelings, Michael left Charlotte no doubt about his."
You ve got everything I m looking for and I never found before in one woman.
"And you re very, very sexy."
It s not that big of a deal is it?
Can t you just do it for me?
Would you really want me to do something that I didn t want to do?
You ll get used to it.
"Well, I plan on getting a lot of blow jobs in the future and I m hoping that you re around when I get them."
What s that supposed to mean?
It means I ll have to find them somewhere else.
"You re telling me that you would give up a woman who really cares for you, who would share your hopes and your fears and your dreams, the future possible mother of your children, all for a blowjob?"
"Will you at least, lick my balls?"
"Michael was upset but butterscotch seemed pleased, she was finally back in her monogamous relationship."
"Half past midnight in a city that never sleeps, neither did the Real Estate market."
It went off the market at mid night and you re the first one to see it.
"Two bedrooms, pre war, fireplace and a view."
"I love it, I really love it."
I can t believe that you were working with another broker.
I can t believe you weren t gonna show me this apartment.
am and I already have a new man in my life.
"You know the greatest thing about writing a successful book, besides the validation the acclaim?"
knowing that I m pumping my ideas to the world.
I thought it was the fact that you could behave like an utter asshole and people would find you amusing.
"I m like in love with you, you know that?"
I m like fucking in love with you.
Will you go out with me tonight?
Give me a minute; I just have to make a call.
I just had to let you know that I m at this very cool party for very cool people under thirty and this very cool novelist wants to take me home.
What the hell happened to you?
"His name is Jared, he s really cute and really successful and he just put his arms around me."
I don t know where you are.
"I m at the Lennard Park Caf??, meet me up front."
Your name is not on the list.
Forty five minutes later I realized I was alone in a park at
What are you doing back here?
you said to meet out front.
"This isn t the front, this is the back, I ve been waiting out front for thirty goddammn minutes."
"That s the front, you were waiting at the street entrance."
The street entrance is the front entrance.
Depending on where you re coming from.
"Ok, I m here now, what s going on?"
"I ve done the merry go round, I ve been through the revolving door, I feel like I met somebody I can stand still with for a minute and Don t you want to stand still with me?"
You drag me out to a park at
In a city of infinite options sometimes there s no better feeling than knowing you already have one.
Once upon a time in a magical land called Manhattan a young woman fell in love.
Charlotte and Jack locked eyes at a black tie benefit for Epstein Barr.
She chased him through every disease in New York.
They've been officially dating since retinitis pigmentosis.
"Architect, philanthropist and the sex was amazing."
"Late one night, Jack popped the inevitable question."
"God, I'd love to own my own gallery and maybe a little cottage in Maine."
"Actually, I meant more like screwing in an airplane bathroom kind of fantasies."
The closest Charlotte had ever come to getting screwed on a plane was the time she lost all her luggage on a flight to Palm Beach.
Well I've always wanted to do it in my parents' bed.
"Charlotte, you have no idea how sexy you are, do you?"
"The idea of you touching another woman God, it makes me hard just thinking about it."
Jack wants us to do a threesome.
They're the blow job of the '.
What was the blow job of the '?
Don't let him pressure you into it.
It's just this guy's cheap ploy to watch you be a lesbian for a night.
Don't knock it till you've tried it.
"I had a threesome once, I think."
I woke up in someone else's bra.
The only way to do a threesome is to be the guest star.
"The girl the couple gets to come in, screw and leave."
Great sex without wondering what it will do to your relationship.
Which is why I have great sex.
You won't even wear a thong.
"You start thinking you're hot, then he brings up the threesome thing."
Suddenly you're kissing another woman while he beats off.
Just make sure the other woman isn't a friend.
"Use somebody random, somebody you meet in a bar or something."
"I think I'd feel safer with a friend, with someone I could trust."
"But I'd go with someone who has a little more experience, like Sam."
But there is something sexy about a first timer like Charlotte.
I'd do it with you guys.
It's like picking teams for dodgeball all over again.
Were threesomes the new sexual frontier?
"And when I started looking, they were everywhere."
"After all, our lives are built on threesomes."
Maybe we were never meant to do it with only one other person.
Maybe threesomes were the relationship of the future.
"Meanwhile, Samantha had been busy guest starring in a show I like to call Sam Does the Married Guy."
I love that you're not my wife.
"I mean, that thing you do with your hips"
Ruth won't even get on top.
Ken was a wine importer unhappily married to a woman who designed modular office furniture.
This affair was the most exciting thing that had happened to him since the 'Montrachet.
"Five hours later, Charlotte's night was just beginning."
She and Jack had just had another fantastic date dancing for dyslexia.
"So, what do you think of her?"
I think she was flirting with you.
"You are such a turn on, and you have no idea."
You're giving off this sexual energy all the time.
A vibe like you've got a fire inside of you.
She'd be crazy not to be in to you.
Who knows whether it was her vodka or her vibe but Charlotte suddenly did feel a little warm.
I think she put her hand on my leg.
Should I ask her to join us?
That night she had an eye opening experience.
Charlotte hadn't been that excited since she tried on her cheerleading uniform.
What do you think your dream meant?
"I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam and Carrie and they won't play with me."
"I'm in the sand box with Charlotte, Sam and Carrie and they won't play with me."
"Across town, Miranda was dealing with her own nightmare."
"I know it's juvenile, but it bothers me."
Plenty of people should want me for a threesome.
So you're saying you're attracted to your girlfriends.
"But if your friends won't go down on you, who will?"
I can't stop thinking about it.
And I think I enjoyed it.
Dreams are a good way to experiment.
It's like buying a dress and keeping the tags on.
Do you think it means I should do it?
Jack says that I have a fire inside me.
Tell him they make a cream for that.
"It's your call, but don't do it just to make Jack happy."
Maybe it would bring us closer.
Isn't it weird that you're thinking of sleeping with someone you don't know to get closer to Jack?
How well do we ever know the people we sleep with?
That was the thing about Charlotte.
"Just as you were about to write her off as a Park Avenue Pollyanna she'd say something so right on, you'd think she was the Dalai Lama."
Do you think my hair too shiny today?
"And then, she'd say something else."
"If Charlotte was actually considering a threesome, who wasn't?"
"The Village Voice had more ads looking for threesomes than it did for small, rat infested studios running at a month."
But who actually answered these ads?
Wall Street honcho seeks two horny gal pals for an East Hampton fuck fest at my summer home.
"Sweet, suburban school teacher seeks two men to fulfill her wildest fantasies."
"You be black or hispanic, I'll be on time."
X Files fanatic twosome seeks Scully look alike for abduction fantasy.
Let's experience everything the city has to offer.
"I'm into museums, blow jobs, theater and golden showers."
I seem to be the only person in New York who still believed in the one on one relationship.
Big and I were actually doing sleep overs.
I could get used to this.
Why is it that putting a tie around a man's neck is sometimes even sexier than taking it off?
What are you doing for lunch today?
I could maybe swing an hour between meetings.
Suddenly my column was the last thing on my mind.
"We used to, but now we have sweet sex."
But he's not with her anymore.
Because they stopped having wild sex.
His wife won't give him a blow job.
Should that make me feel better?
He's never going to leave his wife for you.
Sounds like you're selling toilet bowl cleaner.
Does this color turn you on?
You had to hand it to Miranda.
There's only one thing left to do.
Leave him before he leaves me?
We don't really know the people we sleep with.
"After all, what did I really know about Mr."
"Except he had an ex wife named Barbara, who, I discovered, worked in publishing."
"I'd pitch her a steamy, bodice ripping paperback which she'd probably reject but at least I'd get five minutes face to face with her."
I'm a huge fan of your work.
"So, I'm dying to hear your pitch."
I never knew you were interested in writing children's books.
"Well, who doesn't love children's books?"
Five minutes of bodice ripping material out the window.
So I did what any writer would do.
I pulled an idea out of my ass.
"Well, my story is about a little girl named Cathy, Little Cathy."
"Well, she's got these magic cigarettes."
Little Cathy and her magic cigarettes.
"Whenever she lights up, she can go anywhere in the whole wide world."
"I mean, that stuff is gonna be all worked out, of course."
You want to write a children's book about smoking?
It's a children's book for adults.
I have been dying to do something with an edge.
"She was smart, beautiful, and she got me."
"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have her own encounter with the third kind."
She bought pinot noir from me.
"Sam, this is my wife Ruth."
That afternoon was a first for Samantha.
She successfully screwed a guy in under two minutes.
"The more Miranda analyzed, the worse her nightmares got."
"So, the four of us get into a cab, only they won't let me sit in back with them."
"They make me ride in front with the driver, who's the original Chris from The Partridge Family."
What I'm hearing is you're still very upset about being sexually rejected by your friends.
Would you do a threesome with me?
I think we need to talk about why you're asking me that.
I take that as a no.
That night I thought I could put the whole Barbara thing out of my mind.
Let me show you how it's really done.
So I guess you couldn't avoid a threesome because even if you're the only person in the bed someone has always been there before you.
"Your ex wife's breasts, your ex wife's lips your ex wife's long legs."
"You know, I didn't tell you I was married because it was a long time ago."
Alienation of affection followed by divorce.
Let's not talk about the past.
Big didn't realize was the past was sleeping right next to me.
"The next day, the flesh and blood Barbara asked me to lunch."
"Listen, I have some not great news."
The head guys didn't go for Little Cathy.
They wouldn't know a good book if it bit them in the ass.
And at the risk of sounding like a groupie I'd really like it if we could become friends.
"Two hours and four chardonnays later, I was sleeping with the enemy."
Wandered right over to my best friend.
"For Samantha, the shit was about to hit the phone."
"This is Ruth Scheer, Ken's wife."
I found your number in his drawer.
"Sam's no muss, no fuss affair was starting to feel very mussy."
I don't know who you are but Ken and I love each other very much.
"Whatever it takes, I'll keep this marriage together."
"Listen, this was a huge mistake."
"And if being sexually adventuresome will keep this marriage together, then I am prepared to join you with him in bed."
Series regular was not in her contract.
That night at the Attention Deficit Disorder Masked Ball Charlotte felt free to indulge her fantasy.
It's amazing what sequins on a stick can do to free up inhibitions.
I need to get out of here.
Doing it upstairs at a party.
She realized that this was her moment.
"If she was going to take the plunge, it was now or never."
"Unfortunately, it was Jack who plunged first."
Apparently someone else's fire was a little stronger than Charlotte's.
She was not the guest star in this fantasy.
"Most of the women who answered our ad, they were kind of"
We've never done anything like this before.
It's a huge fantasy of Mark's.
I offered to do it for this h birthday.
Whatever happened to giving a nice pen?
Let me just be clear here.
You want to do a threesome with me.
Let me just make a quick phone call.
"That night, Miranda finally got her validation."
Her shrink had suggested she come three times a week.
"Actually, the food was terrible, and we were talking to each other like strangers."
"Look, you tell me you have an ex wife."
You tell me you guys had a three way.
"You drop this big bomb, and you don't give me any details."
You didn't tell me why you broke up.
She told me she told you.
You didn't tell me that you're still talking to her.
I still talk to all my ex wives.
I'm so not finding that funny.
The reason we had the threesome is because we were both looking for something or someone else.
Do you know anyone who's right for me?
Then it was just the two of us.
And I realized the real appeal of the threesome: It was easy.
In a city of perfect people...
no one was more perfect than Brooke.
She was an interior designer who only dated A list guys.
"For Brooke, every Saturday night was like the senior prom."
we were all dying to see which one had made the cut.
Was I the only one who remembered that Brooke once described this man...
as more boring than exposed brick?
Investment bankers and the women who hate them...
"classmates from Steiner, Dalton and Brown..."
We looked like The Witches of Eastwick.
A wedding this size always has two singles tables.
We were at the other one.
"I'm Bernie Turtletaub, friend of the groom."
A Manhattan legend known for two things:
This outfit only works if I am standing.
I think it works either way.
"You know, I think I'm at that table over there."
What do I have to do to get to know her better?
Do you think the pears in this tart are bosc or bartlett?
"Two hours later, we were bored."
and one of our passengers had jumped ship.
Are we gonna stick around and catch the bouquet?
That is so not going to happen.
Can you believe I finally did it?
Bill's got some great single friends.
It's always better to marry someone who loves you more than you love them.
People are always telling me things I don't want to hear.
But this one crossed the line.
Why do people get married if they're not in love?
I was a fool in love.
And then I was a fool in divorce court.
Which is why I'm never getting married again.
"Suddenly, I had to concentrate on breathing."
Are you in bed with someone?
Just three slices of wedding cake.
What are your plans for the frosting?
I hung up the phone wondering...
could I date a man who would never get married?
A guy who doesn't want to get married
Don't tell me you're surprised by this.
You know who wants to get married?
Maybe this wasn't my target audience.
Am I the only one who thinks this is a major bummer?
What if you spend five years with him and in the end you have nothing to show for it?
I wasn't thinking about marriage until he told me to think about it.
Now it's all I think about.
Then he'll wonder why you don't...
"which will make him realize he does, and then it's a whole new ball game."
"So in your world, it's always sixth grade."
I think that a relationship has to be based on honesty and communication if it has any chance of succeeding.
If you were that would be adorable...
"but you're now, so that's just stupid."
"I can't just ignore it, can l?"
"ln years, men are gonna be obsolete anyway."
"Already you can't talk to them, you don't need them to have kids with..."
you don't even need them to have sex with anymore...
as I've just very pleasantly discovered.
Sounds like somebody just got their first vibrator.
And I think I'm in love.
I'm not gonna replace a man with some battery operated device.
"You say that, but you haven't met The Rabbit."
"If you're gonna get a vibrator, at least get one called The Horse."
A vibrator does not call you on your birthday.
A vibrator doesn't send you flowers the next day...
and you cannot take a vibrator home to meet your mother.
I know where my next orgasm is coming from.
Who here can say as much?
"That night, Samantha went on a date with a flesh and blood man..."
while the three of us went in search of furrier companionship.
"Ladies, I'd like you to meet the Rabbit."
Think about the money we spend on shoes.
I have no intention of using that.
I'm saving sex for someone I love.
Is there a man in the picture?
"I thought it would be all scary and weird, but it isn't."
The little bunny has a little face like Peter Rabbit.
How lazy do you have to be?
"Later that night, back at the brier patch"
You are not going to believe the evening I've had.
"Jerry, who Samantha met at Brooke's wedding..."
"took her to Lava, New York's restaurant du jour."
"From the moment I saw you at that wedding, I knew we'd have dinner together."
"I'm the kind of guy, I see something..."
"I like it, I go after it."
You sound like my kind of guy.
Ten minutes and a couple of cocktails later
He obviously had seen something else he liked and gone after it.
"Then, just when she thought her evening couldn't get any worse"
Are you here all by yourself?
What Samantha needed now more than anything was a compliment from anyone.
I was just thinking about you
"So, do you like this shirt?"
My ex girlfriend picked it out for me.
"Honey, no offense, but your breath"
It's these Chinese herbs I'm taking.
"Well, with breath like that, you're gonna live a very long life alone."
I killed the last woman who talked to me like that.
The Turtle had attempted a joke.
"Once we get the breath under control, I'm gonna take him shopping for a whole new wardrobe."
He's a cute little fixer upper.
"Sweetheart, he's a man, not a brownstone."
"Honey, when I'm through with him, he'll be Gracie Mansion."
"But then again, I'm dating a man who will never get married..."
and Miranda is having a meaningful relationship with something that comes in a box from Japan.
"In a city of great expectations, is it time to settle for what you can get?"
"Later that week, I met Brooke."
"Just back from her honeymoon, she was all business: the business of marriage."
Is there any way you can melt them down into one decent gift?
"So, how is it being married?"
I feel like an enormous weight has been lifted.
"It just means you're happy with Allen, right?"
"Listen, I hope I didn't give you the wrong idea."
and we're happy just to have some guy who can throw around a frisbee.
It was the Turtle wearing Helmut Lange.
He's like a whole new person.
I'm taking him to Bliss for a facial.
"Samantha left with the Turtle, Brooke left with a better gift..."
and I left wondering if everyone in Manhattan was settling.
My Zen teacher once told me that there was nothing like yoga to quiet a busy mind.
Just as I had reached the moment of no thought
I think I broke my vagina.
"I'm scared if I keep using it, I won't be able to enjoy sex with a man again."
Have you ever been with a man..You know...
and he's like... he's doing everything and it feels good...
but somehow you just can't manage to
"Well, it's weird, 'cause with the Rabbit it's like every time, boom"
"And one time, I came for like five minutes."
"Yeah, but no man ever did that."
You could still enjoy sex with a man and the Rabbit.
I'm never going to touch that thing again.
I got to cancel on the ballet tonight.
Charlotte could never tell a decent lie.
I knew an addict when I saw one.
"The music, the sex, the costumes"
"You only like it because she gets to sleep for years, and she doesn't age."
I invited Stanford to the ballet.
I've had it with the whole gay scene.
You won't believe what happened to me last week.
"Evidently Stanford, tired of bars and blind dates..."
decided to place a personal ad.
"He scheduled a rendezvous with the only respondent on a cold, Sunday afternoon."
"Twenty minutes and three false alarms later, he was ready to call it quits."
Even guys like me don't want guys like me.
I just don't have that gay look.
You look pretty gay to me.
"Come on, maybe it's just a phase."
Fifteen years of rejection is a lifestyle.
Sometimes I think I should just marry a woman and get all the money.
"What is there, a cash prize?"
My grandmother gives everyone in the family their inheritance when they get married.
"Maybe you should propose to me, and we'll all live happily ever after."
You really do want it all.
"Though, you do have a point."
This is not a bad idea at all.
Who else would keep you in expensive shoes and encourage you to cheat?
Friday night at the ballet with a man who shared my passion for hot men in tights.
Saturday afternoon in bed with a man who shared my passion for passion.
Maybe there was such a thing as having it all.
"Oh, I got a marriage proposal last night."
"A very handsome, witty young man about to come into his inheritance."
That should make for an interesting column.
What are you gonna do about sex?
I guess you've got it all figured out...
"The more he mocked me, the more convinced I became that this idea was genius."
"That night, Miranda and I had plans to join Charlotte..."
for a gallery opening in Chelsea when
"I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have to cancel."
That was Charlotte speak for I'm spending the night with my vibrator.
"But you guys have fun, though."
There was only one thing to do.
"Charlotte, you hid the Rabbit behind a stuffed rabbit?"
You have a lot of nerve coming in here.
You're the one who made me get it.
I thought you could handle it.
I'd just rather stay home with the Rabbit than go out with men.
"With a little help from her friends, Charlotte decided"
that she wasn't going to settle for herself.
While Samantha was doing everything in her power to remake the Turtle
into a man she could fall in love with.
I can't figure out whether the mushrooms are shitake or chantrelle.
"It was then that Samantha realized that even with all her effort,"
he was still just the Turtle in black.
"You know, I'm not feeling very well."
I think I'm going to have to send myself home.
My ex girlfriend picked it out.
After phone calls and three e mails...
Stanford badgered me into at least meeting his grandmother.
I love that suit you're wearing.
Grandmother's been wearing that same suit for years.
It never goes out of style.
"I have it in blue, black, pink."
Stanford tells me you're a writer.
"Yes, I have a column in The Star."
"I was a career woman many, many years ago."
But I gave it up to have children.
Doesn't she look exactly like Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember?
I had no idea you had such a big family.
As I looked around at all the memorabilia and family photographs...
"the faces of brides and grooms, children and grandchildren..."
Go in the kitchen and get me some matches.
"But you know, he is a fruit."
I realized then that the only inheritance Stanford was going to get from his grandmother...
was her collection of Chanel suits.
"That night at dinner, I knew I would have to break the news to Big."
I do want to get married someday.
I can't date somebody that won't.
"I mean, it's all in the timing."
"before you put in the onions, know what I mean?"
I thought we were having fun.
"It's bitter, but it definitely has possibilities."
You have a little bit of sauce on the lip...
My Zen teacher also said the only way to true happiness...
is to live in the moment and not worry about the future.
"Of course, he died penniless and single."
Sometimes there is nothing harder in life than being happy for somebody else.
Like lottery winners or extremely successful people who are
Then there's that hell on Earth...
that only your closest friends can inflict on you
You could not drag me to that thing if you put a grappling hook in my mouth.
"Frankly, I think it's sad, the way she's using a child to validate her existence."
Why can't she just use sex and a nice cocktail like the rest of us?
"If I see another crepe paper stork, I'm gonna rip its cardboard beak off."
"Can I ask you, would any baby shower bother you..."
or is this one worse because it's Laney's?
You just had to know her.
Chances are eight years ago you probably did.
"So help me, she fucks on my couch, she buys it."
Isn't that how you got the couch from me?
You guys have seen enough of my tits.
Laney did A R for a record label...
"or, as she used to call it, sex with an expense account."
"Every time she went on a scouting trip, she came back with some hot new group..."
and a gynecological condition no one had ever heard of.
"Those things make so many public appearances, they need a booking agent."
"Look at her, the poster girl for low self esteem."
"I have low self esteem, but I express it the healthy way"
by eating a box of Double Stuff Oreos.
Samantha and Laney had a long standing rivalry.
"Two years ago, Laney did the most shocking thing of all."
"She met a Wall Street investment banker, married him..."
She was supposed to have sex with Sid Vicious and move to heroin.
We've never even been to visit her in Connecticut.
"They all think the same, dress the same..."
and sacrifice themselves to the same cause babies.
"Hey, I've lost two sisters to the motherhood."
I know what I'm talking about.
It's the right thing to do.
Wild Laney is having a baby shower.
It's the right thing to do.
Just imagine how fat she must be.
"As I penciled in the date, I noticed something missing."
In between the Versace show and dinner at Moomba...
"That Saturday, also known as Seven Days Late ..."
four city girls set off to visit the country mice.
"I've already had two of these, so we're gonna be stopping a lot."
Is there gonna be some belly dancing at the shower?
I forgot to buy her a present.
How tacky is it to give the mother to be a fistful of cash?
You can go in on mine.
You bought a pregnant woman a bottle of Scotch?
That meant bring your own baby.
"Seriously, what did you get her?"
Look at the size of that thing.
We could drive that to Connecticut.
I'm putting my name on that card.
Does anybody know how to drive?
As I turned the midsize coupe onto Hollyhock Lane...
I was struck by how a place so filled with nature...
"Oh, Toto, I don't think we're in Manhattan anymore."
"Oh, and look at her dog"
"Charlotte sweetie, don't forget our gift."
I can eat anything I want.
"Brigid, Roxanne, these are my friends from the city."
We didn't think you'd make it.
"Remember that feeling, like if you left Manhattan...even for a second,"
you'd fall off the edge of the earth?
"Speaking of Bellinis, I'm gonna have a big drink."
Is she still barhopping and bed hopping?
It's so sad when that's all you have.
She's doing this in vitro thing.
She's not supposed to move at all.
That's Betsy and her boy Harry.
We call them our old married couple.
Except it's not that funny since Betsy and her husband are getting divorced.
So all I have to do to meet the ideal man is give birth to him.
"He is a god, and I tell him so every day."
"Thirty years from now, what do you think the chances are..."
that some woman's gonna be able to make Andy happy?
I wish they made this in my size.
"I told you, it's a cult."
"Once they isolate you from the herd, it's all over."
As I watched Laney tear open a terry cloth baby bib...
with the same enthusiasm she once reserved...
for tearing off rock stars' pants...
"If you're not back in five minutes, I'm coming after you."
"The truth is, I needed to escape."
The party had turned into a preview...
a preview of a life I didn't know if I was ready for.
"Even seven months pregnant, Laney couldn't keep her clothes on."
"Clearly, a part of the old Laney had survived."
"But I wondered, what was still buried..."
"Before I married my husband, I slept around with everybody."
Now I have an lnternet lover.
"When I was senior vice president, people reported to me on a daily basis."
Now I just yell at the gardener...
who doesn't understand a single word.
"But every now and then, I can't help but think about..."
Sometimes I climb up into the kids' tree house...
"with my Walkman, light up a joint..."
There's a woman in there breast feeding a child who can chew steak.
You know how I feel about that?
"If you can ask for it, you're probably too old to have it."
maybe it's maturity or the wisdom that comes with age...
"but the witch in Hansel and Gretel, she's very misunderstood."
"I mean, the woman builds her dream house..."
and these brats come along and start eating it.
I just have to tell you your home is beautiful.
I know it's a big change.
"But at some point, you have to get serious and settle down."
"I mean, life is not a Jacqueline Susann novel"
four friends looking for life and love in the big city.
You are not going to clean up at your own shower.
"Relax, 'cause once Todd or Shayla comes around, you'll never stop cleaning up."
I thought your name was Charlotte.
"It's my name, my secret baby name..."
that I made up when I was years old for my daughter when I had her.
Don't tell me you don't remember.
Charlotte had made us all swear never to use it.
Anyway my husband heard it somewhere else.
I can't believe you're freaking out over a name.
"I mean, you're not even pregnant."
Beers and bar nuts at Flanagan's off Route Five...
were the perfect antidote to Laney's House of Humiliation.
"If I hadn't waited this long to have a baby, that name would be mine."
You have plenty of time to have children.
I don't want to be one of those year old moms.
I don't want to be one of them either.
There are no frozen eggs in my freezer.
This is why I hate baby showers.
"Well, l, for one, love my life."
And I will not be made to feel inadequate by all this baby talk.
I spoke to a woman with a master's in finance.
All she wanted to talk about was her Diaper Genie.
It doesn't have to be like that.
You don't have to lose yourself to have a kid.
"I know plenty of cool, hip mothers..."
who live in the city and still have great careers and stuff.
"Paddy, honey, where are those beers?"
"I don't know, just a few Seven days."
"True, you're in front of the firing squad..."
I was once ten days late.
What are you going to do?
I am not going to tell him until I know what l
till I know how l what
"No, I am not going to tell him..."
until I know how to finish this sentence.
"That night, Charlotte got out her wish box..."
where she kept reminders of all the things she hoped for in life
a town house in the city...
a beach house in East Hampton...
It's very strange when the life you never had flashes before your eyes.
"This one's on sale, half off."
"Sweetie, I just spent on a pair of open toed Gucci's last week."
This is not the place to be frugal
I had a very reassuring moment once with First Response.
I don't think I'd be very good at this.
"When I was a little girl, I left my baby doll out in the rain for four days."
I shaved my Barbie's head when I was mad at her.
"When I was little, I took a rubber band and put it around my dog Pepper's snout."
"Can you picture it, us with"
I'll probably end up with five.
Five hours and two packs of gum later...
I decided I couldn't take the test...
"till I knew exactly how I felt about the results, either way."
I just wanted to tell you it was so great seeing you guys the other day.
"I know I was a big bitch, but you gotta know my hormones are going wild."
"The truth is, Laney's hormones have been going wild since she was ten."
Seeing you made me remember how much fun we used to have.
It's amazing how much time has gone by.
We should get together more often.
"But I mean, we should get together, not just say we're going to..."
Actually Samantha's having one of her parties.
"See, that's the kind of thing I love Samantha's parties."
Samantha did something only Samantha could do.
She threw an l don't have a baby shower...
to let everyone know she was fabulous.
"Yes, I am, but not as much fun as Miranda."
Still convinced that marriage plus baby equals death...
"also known as Ed, Samantha's accountant."
"If she fucks on that couch, she buys it."
"Hey, you guys, the entertainment has arrived"
You think that's a good idea?
What's one little drink gonna matter?
Maybe it'll help me go into labor.
"She gives birth on that couch, she buys it."
"The pathetic, live for the moment New York single girls..."
who think that life is a Jacqueline Susann novel?
"Look, I'm sure you get asked this all the time, but what is your problem?"
"Just that I had a dream and you killed it, in a nutshell."
"You're lucky, because at least you know what happened to your dream."
I have absolutely no idea what happened to mine.
I spent the next hour keeping Charlotte away from Laney...
and Laney away from the vodka.
Look who came up for air.
He's a good kisser and he's gonna do my taxes for free.
"Listen, I've been talking to your friend Charlotte."
Just don't mention the name Shayla.
He was a trader at Bear Sterns...
and had just closed escrow on a house in the Hamptons.
Charlotte suddenly realized all was not lost.
she mentally Scotch taped her dream house back together again.
"Laney, maybe we should think about getting you home, all right?"
"No, I don't wanna go back there."
Who wants to see my tits?
Now we're gonna have a party.
This is at once so sad...
and the most fabulous validation I've ever gotten in my life.
I don't think I can do this.
Despite her best efforts to run free...
it appeared that Laney Berlin's invisible electric fence...
stretched all the way to Manhattan.
"No, I know I can do it."
Just give me one more chance.
"Laney, it's not who you are anymore."
I didn't know that was gonna happen.
Nobody told me that was gonna happen.
"I mean, somebody should warn you."
"One day you're gonna wake up, and you're not gonna recognize yourself."
Can you take her to Connecticut?
I spent the entire next day sitting on a park bench watching children play.
"If I had to, could I do this?"
Would I somehow manage to stay me?
New York City is all about sex.
And people who can't get it.
No wonder the city never sleeps.
It's too busy trying to get laid.
But if you ever actually do manage to get someone in bed...
That's the kind with nuts in it.
After sleeping together for many weeks...
Big and I had gotten comfortable enough to really sleep together.
I'd always dreamed it could be.
I think it might be worse under there.
I hadn't dressed so quickly since the time...
I was caught in the boy's dorm sophomore year.
I didn't call him the rest of the day.
"I tried to lose myself in work, but every time I stopped to think..."
I'd relive my hell all over again.
"The next day, I realized how childish I was behaving."
I decided to stop avoiding the situation and take the grown up approach
I saw the Met is opening a new Goya exhibit.
Do you want to go this Saturday?
"Could you get me some more duck sauce, please?"
"Oh, and we have to stop and see the Renoirs."
There's a moment in every relationship where romance gives way to reality.
You mind if we just call it a night?
That was the first night we slept together and didn't make love.
"By the middle of the next week, it was three times in a row..."
and I was beginning to worry.
Now would be a good time to wipe that horrified look off your face.
I've been at Blockbuster renting videos.
I'm like two rentals away from a free pound a Gummy Bears.
You're just in a dry spell.
I can't believe you said that.
You're all freaked out about three times.
Not doing it when you're with someone means much more...
than not doing it when you're not with someone.
I thought you said everything felt really comfortable and great.
I farted in front of my boyfriend.
And we're no longer having sex.
And he thinks of me as one of the boys.
And I'm gonna have to move to another city...
where the shame of this won't follow me.
I don't want him to know that.
"I mean, he's this perfect guy."
He walks around his perfect apartment with his perfect suit.
"He's perfect, perfect, perfect, and I'm the girl who farts."
No wonder we're not having sex.
then what else is going on?
Is it normal to be in the same bed and not do it?
I guess it depends on what's normal for you.
Who am I to know what's normal?
I haven't dated in a hundred years.
"Well, three months is not normal for me."
"Three months, I am going out of my mind."
There are million single men in New York...
And of these more than million people...
about think they're having enough sex.
I have to masturbate three times a day just to make it through.
"Some people take coffee breaks, I take jerk off breaks."
They say the average year old woman has sex times a week.
I'd like to know who that woman is.
My wife and I haven't has sex since the baby was born.
The baby's applying to Yale next fall.
but two time on very special day.
Normal is the halfway point between what you want and what you can get.
"Even in the plow position, I could count on Samantha..."
Let's move on to downward facing dog.
"With him, I could do it every hour on the hour."
Do you think it means something if Big and I are sleeping together...
When have I ever wanted that?
sex is a barometer for what's going on in the relationship.
"I wasn't going to tell you this, but..."
I did it in front of Big.
"No, honey, you're a woman, and men don't like women to be human."
"We aren't supposed to fart, douche..."
use tampons or have hair in places we shouldn't.
"I mean, hell, a guy once broke up with me because I missed a bikini wax."
This is a watershed relationship moment I'm never gonna be able to erase.
Just go over there and fuck his brains out and he'll forget all about it.
Let your breathing work with you.
Would you like to go for a coffee sometime?
minutes and three animal positions later...
Samantha and Siddhartha were sipping green tea...
at a nearby health food restaurant.
I always feel so amazing after yoga.
"My body feels so open, so alive..."
I gave up sex three years ago.
"I'd have sex mooring, noon and night."
"Sometimes three women a day, and I was always ready for more."
And where I am now is so much better than sex.
Your sexual energy's just starting to awaken.
Now imagine a three year foreplay...
where all that sexual energy is coursing through your body...
Until your entire being is humming with that electric sexual energy.
My apartment's just around the corner.
The only thing hotter than sex is not having sex.
"Amazingly, talking dirty about not having sex..."
was the most sexually deviant act...
Samantha had participated in for months.
The next night when I met Charlotte for dinner...
I had reached my own transcendental state.
The first time he was tired.
There's nothing wrong with your relationship.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her.
I was afraid she'd go spontaneously deaf.
People put too much emphasis on the importance of sex.
It's not the most important thing in a relationship.
"Take Kevin and l, for example."
"We've been going out for weeks, and we still haven't done it."
"I mean, we touch and cuddle..."
"but he's sweet, and he respects my boundaries."
Meeting a friend's new boyfriend for the first time is always a little tense.
What if you don't like him?
What if he doesn't like you?
"Kevin, this is my good friend Carrie."
What if you've already slept with him?
"Well, kind of used to go out."
You two used to go out?
We were in different places and l
"Carrie, we don't have time for diplomacy."
When Charlotte discovered that Kevin had tucked his libido away...
"for her comfort level, she was even more moved by his restraint."
I want you to know how much I appreciate your patience.
You've been so patient with me.
Shows how much you really care.
is gonna make it all the more special for us now.
There's only gonna be one stop.
I don't think this is gonna work.
I'm just not that sexual a guy.
"Look, Carrie told me that you were quite sexual."
"In fact, I believe she used the word maniac."
I used to be such a mess.
The only downside is it takes the air out of my tires.
"After a while, it's kind of like a taffy pull."
I wish I could say I felt worse...
"but to tell you the truth, these days, nothing gets me down."
You want to watch a movie?
for what could become another platonic sleepover...
I paced my apartment and tried not to think about our lack of sex when
"There they were, my new neighbors"
Mr. and Mrs. Get it on.
A couple so obviously into each other there was only one thing to do
Is it okay if I come over?
"Meanwhile, across town at the corner of Nirvana and West Third..."
Siddhartha was helping Samantha along her newfound path.
Blocks are connection to our inner life...
are a way to block our spiritual hunger...
I showed up at his apartment feeling sexy and confident.
Wearing my secret weapon skirt that really hugged my hips...
Would you knock it the fuck off?
I'm trying to watch this fight.
Why are you acting so nuts?
Maybe I don't fit into your perfect life...
with your perfect apartment and your perfect pay per view fight.
I stood there and waited for the obligatory...
he's coming to stop me ten seconds.
"By the time I got home, I was sure he'd left an apology on my voice mail."
You have no new messages in your mailbox.
I didn't sleep very well that night...
but I wasn't the only one.
After a night of spiritual reading with her hunky guru...
Samantha began to feel things she hadn't felt in a very long time
She decided it was time to put an end to her suffering.
But just as she reached the place Krishna called the gateway to life...
she turned back and decided not to enter.
"After all, she'd come this far."
She could continue not to come at all.
In an effort to get her mind off sex...
Miranda had rented a five hour Danish documentary...
Why don't you quick drop this?
"I got what you want, I got what you need."
Like every woman consumed with a relationship problem...
I needed a project to keep my mind from obsessing...
and my hands from dialing his number.
Miranda needed to keep her hands busy as well.
I've heard enough about the fart.
I know it's not the fucking fart.
I just...I think I'm in love with him...
and I'm terrified that's he's gonna leave me because I'm not perfect.
Let's just put the roller down and go in the other room and talk.
What if he never calls and three weeks from now...
I pick up The New York Times and I read that he's married...
some perfect little woman who never passes gas under his sheets.
When did you get so obsessed with being perfect?
You should see me around him.
"I wear little outfits sexy Carrie, and casual Carrie."
Sometimes I catch myself actually posing.
Why don't you show him more of this Carrie?
What if he doesn't like her?
I had no idea they did an afternoon show.
"When a show is good, word gets around."
"There we were, the ' version of matinee ladies."
Who said the theater was dead.
"Samantha, I cannot believe that you would give this up on purpose."
"It never goes down, does it?"
might be a sign that celibacy's not for you.
All I can say is that my big payoff better be worth it.
There are people starving out there and you're fasting.
At least you can take care of yourself.
"Beside, I think I've given myself carpal tunnel."
"Sure, it's all fun until you get to know each other."
That move is what they're famous for.
How can that guy still be
I have got to try this again with Kevin.
"That's got to be stronger than a drug, right?"
"If I make it to four months, I'm humping one of you."
"After the second show, each of us went on with our Saturdays."
Miranda went to get a movie and another pound of Gummy Bears.
"We got a live one, boys."
"Well, what I want is to get laid."
What I need is to get laid.
"All talk and no action, huh?"
Samantha decided to channel her frustration at yoga.
"Unless you're planning to move those hands down, get them off me."
Exhale and turn around into asana.
She had reached the end of her path and her patience.
Samantha spent the rest of the afternoon having multiple yo gasms.
"Later that night, Charlotte was determined to prove she was stronger..."
than selective serotonin re uptake inhibitors.
"No, I think it's starting to work."
"It's not, and I'm beginning to chafe."
I've just never been in this situation before.
"What, think I'll ever go off it?"
Wouldn't you rather be with a guy who's kind and giving...
and not that interested in sex...
"than an unstable, oversexed prick who only wants to get laid?"
Once Charlotte realized she couldn't get what she thought she didn't want...
she couldn't imagine going on without it.
Saturday night's dinner came and went with no call from Big.
but my cabinets were looking fabulous.
So this is where you live.
About time you invited me up.
The floors need to be stripped and the curtains are
I want to change a lot of it.
I like it the way it is.
What was that all about the other night?
Did you know there's a couple humping outside of your window?
All I could think was why aren't we having sex?
We can do better than that.
How normal can sometimes feel so uncomfortable.
My friend Miranda was dating Thomas John Anderson...
an up and coming New York playwright.
Things were going great except for one thing.
he'd hop out of bed and shower.
"Night after night, it was the same thing."
She decided to confront Thomas John Anderson as soon as he dried off.
You always get up and shower right after we're done.
I'm starting to feel like it's me.
It's just a habit I have.
"Growing up, the nuns told us sex was a sin."
So I just got into the habit of taking a shower after l...
Miranda suddenly realized she was dating Catholic Guy.
So you think the water serves as a retro baptism kind of thing?
If I'd known he was Catholic...
I never would've gone out with him in the first place.
They should make them wear a sign.
rarely ask about their dates' religious backgrounds...
for the same reason they don't ask the number of former sex partners:
Iogical guy in every respect but this.
Leave it to me to find the only religious guy still left in Manhattan.
New York is a city filled with places to worship.
But it recently dawned on me...
the only time I ever heard anyone mention going into one...
Are relationships the religion of the '?
Having been raised in the church of be nice to people...
and don't talk with your mouth full ...
I decided to check out some more traditional religious types...
"As I watched people leaving church, I was amazed at how they looked."
"Valentino, Escada, Oscar de la Renta."
What is it about God and fashion that go so well together?
"And suddenly, there he was wearing Armani on Sunday."
I admit it was kind of a shock.
"Up until that moment, I thought he only believed in the Yankees."
I'm doing a column on closet Presbyterians.
"Actually, I'm an atheist, but don't tell the minister."
I take her to church every Sunday.
How come you never told me?
"Well, you write every Sunday, so"
"You know, I've got minutes before my racquetball game."
"and this cappuccino just kicked in, so"
It was one of those awkward relationship moments...
where you feel like you know nothing about the person...
you thought you knew everything about.
He goes to church with his mother?
A man who cares about mother makes a wonderful husband.
until you get to that shower after sex phase.
It's amazing he has any skin left.
Have you tried taking a shower with him?
I'm afraid he'll pull out garlic and a cross.
"So, which church does his mother go to?"
It's one of the best on the East Side.
ls there a Zagat guide for that?
"Four stars, great bread, disappointing wine selection."
"The thing is, I'm dying to meet his mother."
Getting on the good side of his mother is like closing the deal.
I just had a five hour lunch with James.
Samantha uttering those words to us...
as Moses parting the Red Sea.
It all started a couple of weeks ago...
on a particularly blah Wednesday night.
Samantha decided to treat herself to a night of great music.
I couldn't help but notice how you move to the music.
Trapped in the body of a lawyer.
After they closed the jazz joint they walked and talked for blocks.
You have to at least try one of the glazed.
It's a little bit of heaven.
And I never thought I'd get there.
And then Samantha did something rather shocking for a first date
"And with that one touch, Samantha..."
who was never a believer in relationships...
"I mean, I'd totally given up on the idea that you could actually talk to men."
all my conversations consisted of two sentences
give it to me and go home.
And I owe it all to Charlotte.
about not sleeping with men right away actually paid off.
"I mean...if I'd fucked James already, who knows where we'd be."
I think he's someone I could actually marry.
The idea that Samantha could possibly get married before she did...
shook Charlotte's beliefs to the core.
She made an appointment to see Noanie Stine...
psychic to the stars and a cosmic connection...
who lived in a brownstone between Central Park West and Columbus.
We go to the same Cabala class.
"pick three cards, face down with your left hand."
Charlotte had heard about Noanie through a sorority sister...
whose marriage she had very accurately predicted.
"Ok. Now, is there one question in particular?"
"with great success in your future, but I do not see marriage."
"Well, how can you just say that like that?"
"I mean, what about my feelings?"
"So, who is the fabulous mother in the hat..."
and when do I get to go to church with you two?
You want to go to church?
You say that like I'm the antichrist or something.
It's just I never thought of you as the church type.
The incredibly beautiful and intelligent type.
I'm no one religion in particular.
I want to go to church with you and your mommy.
"Well, it's just a private little thing..."
"my mother and I do, just the two of us."
You want to go to the Caribbean next week?
I'll go pack my jet ski.
We could both use a vacation.
"The sun, the sand, you and me."
"Yeah, but I can't afford it."
"When we get to St. Barts, you can buy me one big margarita."
"I'm just gonna go jump in the shower, and then, boom, I'm all yours."
"Well, thanks for clearing that up."
And what are you gonna tell me next that God made the body...
and if God made the body and sex is an expression of that body...
how could anything made by that God made body be considered sin?
You're free to go work with the lepers now.
I guess this means I'm not going to hell.
Thank you for saving my immortal soul.
Miranda had accidentally detonated some kind of Catholic guilt bomb.
I'm gonna go take a shower.
"When I come out, I'd kind of like it if you weren't here."
"Six months later, that exact same speech..."
would find its way into Thomas John Anderson's...
hit off Broadway play Shower of Shame.
Samantha was preparing to see God.
I know it's only been a couple of weeks...
"Oh, honey, I can't wait any longer."
Just unzip and get over here.
Samantha said a little prayer that he was kidding.
Just get a look at the mother...
then Miranda and I would go for eggs.
Look at how crowded it is.
"It's a Presbyterian church, not a Catholic one."
"All the same, all designed to fuck up our sex lives."
As I watched Big standing quietly next to his mother
I think I fell a little bit more in love with him.
Let's make a break for it.
Aren't you the young lady who made all that noise?
"Mother, this is my friend Carrie."
I searched her face looking for the light of recognition.
I'm just going to say goodbye to the pastor.
You show up at church after I asked you not to.
What are you trying to do?
Why all of a sudden interested in meeting my mother?
Why hasn't the woman even heard of me?
My mother doesn't need to meet...
I'll introduce you as my girlfriend when I'm sure.
"Look, I have to do things on my time frame."
We've been going out for months.
I really don't know what else to say to you.
You just have to have a little faith.
In a couple of days we're going on vacation.
We'll have plenty of time to talk of this.
"Right now, I've got to get my mother home."
He introduced me to his mother as a friend.
I don't know what else I can do.
Late that night in the Church of Disco...
to a party to introduce a new fragrance
"Also, he wanted to show off his new boyfriend..."
It's like hell with a cover charge.
Did I tell you that Allanne designed the Fallen Angel bottle?
I just saw someone I want to say hello to.
So you know what we did today?
We shopped for Deco cabinet handles for his armoire.
I turned into one of those couples we hate and I'm loving it
Stanford and Allanne worshiped the same God
So you all excited for the big vacaciones?
Iike it's some sort of consolation prize for not letting me in his life.
What is going on with you two?
We're not in the greatest place.
He wouldn't introduce me to his mother.
It seems Stanford had invited everyone in his Rolodex.
I was hoping I'd see you here.
I've been totally thinking about you since we broke up.
The months apart had shed a new light on him.
"Actually, they'd shed a new light on his shower free feelings about sex."
"Later that night, the three of us tracked Samantha to the ladies' room..."
to get the lowdown on her love life with James.
We've been looking for you everywhere.
She means have you and James done it yet?
It's not the end of the world.
His dick is like a gherkin
You had certain expectations and you're disappointed.
Why does he have to have a small dick?
I was once with a guy the size of one of those little miniature golf pencils.
Couldn't tell if he was trying to fuck me or erase me.
There are ways to work around this.
I don't want to work around this.
I love it inside of me.
"When I blow him, it's like..."
Can you talk to him about it?
It's the only thing we can't talk about.
How is he with his tongue?
"Charlotte left us all behind, telling us she had another party to go to."
She took a cab to a part of town never mentioned in the New Yorker.
I call the power of all the saints.
"For dollars, we can remove it."
"The entire way home, Charlotte berated herself for being so foolish."
She simply refused to give in to the idea...
that she would never get married.
"All she had to do was keep believing, and it would happen."
It was a.m. in the Church of Disco...
and Miranda couldn't believe what she was about to say.
You want to spend the night?
I knew we'd get back together
Every night I'd light a candle and say a little prayer.
Samantha tried desperately to believe that love was stronger than sex.
I stayed up all night questioning my faith in faith.
"I mean, hadn't I had faith in us all along?"
Faith that all the withholding would stop.
Faith that he'd say I love you.
"I mean, you told me to have faith, but, see..."
"I'm kind of losing mine, so..."
"What, like in those old religious movies?"
You wanna a voice from above?
Just tell me I'm the one.
"You don't have to tell your mother or the whole world, just"
"I love you, but I can't."
"After he left, I cried for a week."
And then I realized I do have faith.
Faith that I would one day meet someone...
who would be sure that I was the one.
When you live on a tiny island like Manhattan the odds of bumping into the one who broke your heart are incredibly high.
The odds of bumping into him when you look like shit are even higher.
"After a break up, certain streets, locations even times of day are off limits."
The city becomes a deserted battlefield loaded with emotional land mines.
You have to be very careful where you step or you could be blown to pieces.
"Get your coat, Anne Frank, we're going out."
I'm really not in the mood.
Only if it's nowhere I can run into him.
Just when exactly do you think you're gonna be getting out of this hostage situation?
"Don't listen to her, it's only been a month."
It takes half the total time you went out with someone to get over them.
I always like a math solution to any love problem.
You and Big only went out for a year.
She's got five more months to get over him.
Cut your losses and get back in the game.
"When Eric and I broke up, I got over him right away."
I don't really remember it being like that.
"Eric, asshole I dated a couple of years ago."
Miranda called Eric the love of her life until he left her for another woman.
"Now, she almost never mentioned him."
You can't push yourself into feeling good.
"The only way to get over somebody is to feel really bad, cry to your girlfriends and to replay what you hated about him over and over in your head all day."
You're too dressed up for where we're going.
The chance of meeting Big looking the way I feel.
"The first meeting is the worst, you never know how to act."
"If Big had any class, he would've moved away."
You're giving him too much power.
"Right, and that makes me what, happy?"
"Amazingly, Samantha was still with James."
A monogamous relationship for a woman whose bedroom was busier than Balducci's on a Saturday.
How are the most beautiful women in Manhattan?
"If we see them, I'll ask."
Don't let anything bad happen to my princess.
"God, everything is going so great."
"Me, James, and his tiny penis: We're one big happy family."
"After two months, despite all his sweetness and charm Samantha still hadn't quite accepted James's shortcomings."
"When Miranda said, Get back in the game, she meant it."
"Forty minutes and a cab ride later, we found ourselves at Yankee Stadium."
Miranda was a fan of the Yankees
I was a fan of being able to smoke and drink at p.m. without judgement
"Coming up to bat, the new Yankee."
"Just up from the Minors, single."
Why are we sitting all the way up here?
It's the only place I can smoke without Giuliani putting me away for years.
You have a man who loves you.
I don't think you ladies understand the seriousness of my situation.
How would you like to make love to this every night?
Can we try and get into the game for a second?
Last year this guy was Mr.
He hit ten home runs in nine days.
As Miranda went on about the new Yankee's stats I couldn 't help wondering about my own.
Ten years playing in New York.
If I were a ballplayer I'd be batting Whatever really bad is.
Do you know what the odds of catching a fly ball are?
But I couldn't help wondering if they were any higher than finding a relationship that would last.
"Three innings, four beers and one shameless flash of my press pass later We waited outside the locker room to get my ball signed by the new Yankee."
"I'm not drunk, I'm sedated from my pain."
"She's allowed to be drunk, she's going through a break up."
We don't mean to bother you but my friend caught your ball.
We were wondering if you'd sign it?
That foul ball to the upper deck?
If it's not too I'm a huge Yankees fan.
"If I don't sign it, you'll sue me?"
I don't know why I said that.
"No problem, give me the ball."
"No, I came for the beer."
I think baseball's a little dull.
I'm gonna ask him to the Dolce Gabbana party.
I don't know if it was the beer or the fact that I was holding his ball.
Something gave me the strength to ask the new Yankee out.
This is not the way this is supposed to happen.
You told me to get back in the game.
Nobody rebounds with the new Yankee.
Let's blow this hot dog stand.
"She knew it was risky, but a day of watching big men swing their big wooden bats proved to be too much for Samantha."
She told herself there's no harm in just looking.
As my ballpark cheap beer buzz wore off I began to worry about the ramifications of my day.
"Were we supposed to get over an ex in a slow, painful way?"
Or should we ignore all the bad feelings and throw ourselves back in the game?
In a world where leaving each other seems to be getting more frequent What are the break up rules?
"Whatever you do, man, don't cry."
"Cause if you do get back together again, then, you're the guy that cried."
Don't call or see him 'til three months have passed and you've lost the weight you put on while breaking up.
"Give her whatever she wants, but don't sign a motherfucking thing."
"Change your name, change your phone number."
"Friday night, the Dolce Gabbana party."
The new Yankee was minutes late.
"I was reaching for my favorite necklace when I thought I'd destroyed all the evidence, but there it was."
We'd taken it with a disposable camera before it ever dawned on me that we could be disposable as well.
It was then and there I created my own very first break up rule: Destroy all pictures where he looks sexy and you look happy.
The party was a complete home run.
All the fashion heavy hitters were there.
Charlotte was dating Paul Ericson the V.P.
Of a major recording label's classical and jazz division.
This guy's never heard Miles Davis.
I don't really like that jazz stuff.
I'm gonna give you our Best of Miles Davis CD.
His stuff will change your mind.
His concentration and emotion in the phrasing It's fucking magical.
The authenticity of Miles' timbre is gonna blow you away.
The fusion revolution changed the entire concept of contemporary music.
"There we were, two single gals out on the town with our ballplayers."
Do you think he'll be here?
"I don't know, I hadn't thought about it."
Break up rule number two: Lie.
It's a lot easier than admitting that's why you invited the new Yankee and why you maxed out your credit card to buy the dress.
"Big never made an appearance, I decided to make the best of it."
I actually got to know a little about this new Yankee.
"So, Joe, the new Yankee How'd you like your first fashion party?"
Are you making fun of me?
"And there, in the shadow of my island just four weeks out of my last relationship I let the new Yankee get to first base."
"Our Saturday morning ritual: Coffee, eggs, and a very private dish session."
Today our dish wasn't so private.
"Hot Yankee Joe Stark on the town with New York columnist and 'sex pert', Carrie Bradshaw."
It's a proud day for me.
That dress just paid for itself.
Big is gonna see this and die.
I don't want him to die.
Everybody has got to look at my new Palm Pilot.
"The first time Big sees you, you look great and you're with the Yankee."
Why are we still talking about him?
"Let's talk about something else, okay?"
I have a problem with my boyfriend.
I'm gonna go get the check.
"I don't know really quite how to say this, but he's always touching his"
I didn't know what the hell was going on.
I don't know but it's constant.
He can't seem to leave them alone.
He and every other guy on the planet.
They always try to pull our attention there.
"Sometimes they hang so low, they get in the way."
I heard Nick Nolte had a ball lift.
I don't know how long they are.
You've been dating for three weeks and you haven't seen his balls yet?
But why do men do this?
How would they feel if we stood around in public touching ourselves?
All we talk about anymore is Big or balls or small dicks.
Why do four smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends?
It's like seventh grade with bank accounts.
"What we think, we feel, we know Christ"
Does it always have to be about them?
Give me a call when you're ready to talk about something besides men for a change.
In the case of Miranda Hobbes vs.
"Silly women everywhere, the verdict was in."
"After breakfast, Charlotte and I went shopping."
"Break up rule number three: Until emotionally stabilized, enter no stores."
"Later, Samantha and James were about to enter the seventh inning stretch."
"When I arch my back, I want you to lift that ass and really give it to me."
"Rather than quit mid season, Samantha decided to attack her problem with the gusto of a seasoned coach training a rookie."
A good coach encourages and motivates.
A good coach disciplines and criticizes.
What are you doing back there?
And like every good coach she passed on the benefits of her years of experience.
Get up here and slide inside of me.
"Then, at the bottom of the ninth try, with two balls and two strikes."
"The coach had no choice, but to bring in a pinch hitter."
I thought it would be fun.
I think just us might be more fun.
"That's not a problem, is it?"
But there was no joy in Mudville.
"But a little further uptown, the ball game was just getting started."
I have a present for you.
I thought you just gave me one.
Charlotte had decided a possible solution to her problem might be as simple as briefs vs.
The salesman said that these were the very best.
They're like the Wonderbra for men.
"They give good support, something about the pouch."
We haven't even made love and you're out shopping for me?
But Charlotte couldn't bring herself to tell him the problem was foul balls.
"First comes the underwear, then you move in."
"And then the next thing I know, you hate my music."
He broke it off after only three weeks.
"Charlotte, true to form, was over him in exactly a week and a half."
"Whenever Miranda was feeling stressed, she went for a long walk."
She'd lose herself in the places and faces and whatever was bothering her would somehow lift.
"But today, she would have no such luck."
I really thought he liked me.
Just when Miranda decided she was the only woman in New York with any real perspective on men There he was.
The former love of her life.
Walking hand and hand with the woman he left her for.
Somewhere between playing the Royals and the Red Sox the new Yankee found a minute to teach me some dugout pastimes.
"If you don't get this, we don't move on to spitting."
Break up rule number four: Never stop thinking about him even for a moment because that's the moment he'll appear.
"As he made his way through the crowd, I felt calm."
I had accomplished the perfect first meeting.
"I looked good, I felt good, and I was with the new Yankee."
I saw your picture in the paper.
Some buddies are at a bar on Bleeker. How about it?
"I'm really sorry, it's not you."
This is This is really embarrassing.
I just I just cried in your mouth.
I just I can't I'm not ready.
That guy in the bar That suit guy.
Don't pay any more attention to me.
"I'm just gonna get a cab, all right?"
I went to a pay phone.
I know things are really weird between us right now.
But I really need to talk.
Can you Will you meet me at our place in minutes?
I know you want me to be over him I'm a jerk.
I saw Eric on the street today.
I forgot how hard it is.
"Just take all the time you need, okay?"
"And finally, the most important break up rule: No matter who broke your heart or how long it takes to heal you'll never get through it without your friends."
"Two years ago, my friend Susan Sharon the East Coast rep for a line of Italian cashmere sportswear married a mean man."
What did I tell you about listening to my CDs?
You put Natalie Imbruglia back in U
"Now, I only see her once or twice a year generally when her husband is out of town."
"Now, I can't remember if I've taken my Halcion before dinner or not."
"So I take another one, I have a cocktail, I'm feeling no pain."
"The next thing I know, this freaked out stewardess is slapping me awake."
"I open my eyes, I look around the plane, it's completely empty."
We'd landed in Milan minutes ago.
Come up to my apartment because I have something for you.
Susan Sharon and her husband had one of those very adult apartments that made me feel like I was visiting the home of a friend whose parents thought I was a bad influence.
I know it's a little early.
It's percent Italian cashmere and light as a feather.
Guess what Barneys gets for this.
Do you mind if I return it?
Why do you think they call it cash mere ?
What the hell is going on?
But Carrie had this idea about returning
What was our agreement about visitors after p.m.?
I've got to be up in three hours when the markets open.
I'd really appreciate it if you'd take the fucking noise somewhere else.
Get the fuck out of my house
"Taunting the psychotic spouse, I realized, was not a wise move."
"I wondered could their marriage be that bad, or was their fighting a form of foreplay?"
"In which case, I was merely the catalyst to get things going."
"That was classic Richard: Tyrannical, emotionally abusive."
I don't know what to do anymore.
Maybe there were special circumstances tonight.
Do you think I should leave him?
"If you're not happy, you know, life's too short."
"As I hung up, I realized I had been placed in a classic no win situation."
Telling a friend to leave her husband is something you just don't do.
"If they do break up, it's your fault."
"If they don't, she knows you think they should and therefore, can't speak to you again."
She had me at a weak moment.
"I was tired, I'd been chased out of her apartment."
"No, in an intimate relationship you should be able to say anything."
Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutual delusion.
I pretend he doesn't have a small dick.
He pretends not to notice we haven't had sex in weeks.
"I'm in an intimate relationship at the moment and I can tell you, the level of verbal discourse has become a little too intimate."
Are we speaking of Spring Roll Guy?
He's a dermatologist I met at the Vietnamese lunch truck outside my office.
"The problem, if you can call it that is Spring Roll Guy liked to talk dirty in bed."
"Baby, I just love the way your pussy feels."
So wet and warm and tight.
Kissing your beautiful tits feels unbelievably sexy.
That can be a turn on.
"Sure, but now he wants me to reciprocate."
Because sex is not a time to chat.
"It's one of the few instances in my overly articulated, exceedingly verbal life where it is perfectly appropriate, if not preferable, to shut up."
Now I have to worry about being stumped for conversation?
Just talk about his big cock.
We're using the C word now?
"A simple, You're so hard, is effective."
"You know Yes, stud, that's right."
"So, are you really telling us that during sex you're completely mute?"
"No, I can do a good orgasm alert."
"I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum."
But that's because I'm gonna cum.
Anything else feels like make believe.
"If you really like this guy, you're gonna have to start talking."
Have we put such a premium on being open and honest with one another that we've misplaced the boundaries of propriety?
Are there still certain things in a relationship one should never say?
My best friend got engaged to the biggest loser.
What am I supposed to say?
"My wife, she's had her breasts done twice."
"They look fantastic, they feel like shit."
I keep that thought to myself.
"I'm single, and still hoping to get married."
I don't want to know the truth.
I told Richard I couldn't spend another day married to a man who is an utter asshole.
"There it was, standing across from me."
"Biscotti eating, cashmere swaddled proof that I had said too much."
"Once I said that, the floodgates opened."
"He said that at our wedding, when he looked at me he felt a huge wave of disappointment because I looked so generic."
"I said, On second thought I don't think the Rogaine is working."
"He said that if I leave, all he'll feel for me is pity because he'll be remarried within a year and I'll be single for the rest of my life."
I didn't want to tell Susan Sharon that his last statement was probably true.
I just feel like I owe you so much.
"If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have had the guts to do this."
It's like I was under house arrest for years and now I'm free.
Do you mind if I stay at your place?
"That evening, as Susan Sharon squatted on my couch Charlotte came home to the new male in her life."
"Fed up with lonely mornings, cuddle free nights and the lack of unconditional love she longed for Charlotte took matters into her own hands."
"She combed the city for the perfect specimen of breeding, style and trendiness."
"Until she found the perfect man, Charlotte would have the perfect dog."
"That night, Samantha, who was never good at keeping a secret found the one thing she couldn 't say was the only thing she could think about."
"If there is, I want you to tell me."
"I feel like you've become so distant, like you're upset with me about something."
Will you come see a couple's counselor with me?
Samantha dreaded the shrink the way most people feared the dentist.
If it's really important to you
She longed for the simple days of emotional unavailability and hot one night stands.
"Meanwhile, across town, Miranda was appearing as Eliza Doolittle in My Filthy Lady."
I just love kissing this sensitive spot right here.
"You like my hand there, caressing your breast?"
"Surprisingly, once Miranda opened her mouth, it was difficult to shut up."
"A big, throbbing, rock hard sausage."
"That night, I took Susan Sharon to meet the new male in Charlotte's life."
"True to form, he was already falling far short of her high expectations."
He did it a minute ago.
"We can't stay, I want to be at your place if Richard calls."
"If he calls, I want to say I won't talk to him."
You should only talk if you have something to say.
Do you believe I married a prick?
You didn't know he was a prick.
I just can't believe that prick hasn't called.
"Although, he does have this sweet side."
You just don't know him very well.
"Did I do the right thing, Henry?"
Should I give him another chance
"He's a dog, not an oracle."
"The next morning, I woke up to an unsettling birthday surprise."
What do you think it means?
It means rip up the card.
And watch out for the thorns.
"No, this is the grand gesture."
"If you break up, and he disappears from your life it wasn't meant to be."
"But if they make a powerful declaration of their love, then you have to reconsider."
"You think a dozen roses and a card saying, Best wishes qualifies as a grand gesture?"
"They can never say, I was wrong."
Sometimes a rose is just a rose.
I really don't need this on my birthday.
"What does this mean, the ball's in my court or something?"
I don't want to play games.
This is not the grand gesture.
This is the vague gesture which is worse than no gesture.
"Under the guise of thoughtfulness, he's being very selfish."
"I agree, he's muddied the waters."
He sends flowers on her birthday and you condemn him.
"For chrissake, give the dog a break."
He's eaten four pairs of shoes.
I don't want him starting on purses.
"You wanted to get out and socialize, but you'll have to learn to behave."
Charlotte was at the point where she was starting to see the real Henry.
But she did raise a valid question.
"Was, I was wrong, the one thing Mr."
I realized that just because we were no longer together didn 't mean I couldn 't be polite.
I wanted to call and thank you for the flowers.
"My secretary had it on her calendar, so I, you know"
"I sent the flowers, my secretary alerted me to the day."
That was very thoughtful of her and you for sending them.
What are you doing on the big day?
"Stanford's arranged this party down at Layla, that Moroccan restaurant."
"The instant the words popped out of my mouth, I regretted them."
Come and bring that person and maybe I'll see you later.
Thank you again for the thoughtful flowers.
I had just invited my ex and his date to my birthday party.
As if getting older wasn't traumatic enough.
That afternoon in the office of Velma Rudin celebrated psychologist and author of In to me see A Couple's Guide to Intimacy Samantha did her best not to say the thing she knew she shouldn 't say.
I've noticed that our sex life has diminished.
Have you tried playing erotic games?
Samantha almost confessed that James had been playing hide the salami since they met.
I'm just not feeling very sexual these days.
I saw you masturbating the other day when I came out of the shower.
Many women are simply unable to achieve orgasm through intercourse.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
You have a problem with intimacy.
"Nothing you say can hurt me, as long as it's what you're feeling."
That seems to be all the time we have for today.
"Shall we say next week, same time?"
The idea of seeing Velma In to me see Rudin on a weekly basis was much more than Samantha could bear.
It doesn't and it just it can't.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe your vagina is too big?
As Samantha paid the price of mentioning the unmentionable Miranda discovered that free speech comes with a cost of its own.
I just love putting my hand around your cock.
I just love hearing you say cock.
Why couldn't I ever say that before?
Why does it turn us both on when I say it?
I like it when you're rough.
"When you throw my legs over your head, I lose control."
You like it when I'm biting your nipple.
You like it when I'm kissing your balls.
You really like it when I slip my finger in your ass.
You just love a finger in your ass.
"How could I know, You love a finger in your ass is the one thing you can't say?"
"Trust me, that's not the only thing."
"But it's true, he enjoys it."
So do a lot of men.
"They enjoy it, but don't want it brought to their attention."
"Personally, I don't like anything in my ass."
I know that may come as a surprise.
"He wanted me to talk dirty, I got into it, then he pulled the rug out from under me."
That's why I love my Henry.
You tell him anything and he licks your face.
"Charlotte, you may be onto something."
Another double vodka rocks for the birthday girl.
"The truth was, vodka was my only ally."
"At any moment, Big was gonna walk in with his gorgeous date smile at me like some distant stranger and say something crushing Happy birthday, baby."
"I wasn't aware we were formally dating, but"
It is so good to see you again.
"Marvelous, I split up with a bitch who broke my heart."
"An hour later, my Arabian Nights fantasy birthday felt like Midnight Express."
"Excuse me, what is your ex doing at your birthday?"
I told him to drop by for a drink.
I didn't think he'd stay for a lap dance.
"My God, have you tried the baba ganooj?"
You don't know what you're missing.
I can't believe the bastard dared to come.
I can't believe what she does with her navel.
"Please, I'm about to lose my couscous."
While I watched my ex get a Mesopotamian lap dance Susan Sharon made a play for Mr.
I can't deal with being single all over again.
Every relationship has its ups and downs.
My husband and I work very hard.
We probably don't spend enough damn time together.
Compounded by the fact that neither of us gets enough sleep.
"I really never imagined myself as a divorcee, you know?"
It's more important to till your own soil than to go in search of greener pastures.
Do you ever shut the fuck up?
"In that moment, Susan Sharon realized she desperately missed her husband."
"That night, Charlotte came home to a very unpleasant surprise."
He and Charlotte soon parted ways.
"The one thing she could never say was, I got rid of the puppy."
We all know what happened to him.
He'd become the glue that put Susan Sharon and her husband back together.
Although neither of them could admit that a dog saved their marriage.
"Later that evening, as my birthday passed into the early hours of just another day I found myself alone on the street with Mr."
Can I give you a ride home?
"No, I'm just gonna grab a cab."
"Good, because I think I left all my in that belly dancer's crotch."
"As I watched him go, I realized the one thing I couldn't say to Mr."
Big was I'm still not over you.
"Manhattan, for millions of our forefathers, the gateway to hope opportunity and happiness beyond their wildest dreams."
"Today, that hope is still alive."
"On Saturday nights, every restaurant in Lower Manhattan resembles its own little Ellis Island."
"Hordes of single women crowded into a hot, cramped space hoping to make it to their final destination: The state of matrimony."
Or at least to get a hot meal in transit.
Samantha didn't believe in The First Date.
But she did believe in sex after it.
I think you missed a drop.
Harrison was a very successful litigator who took steam baths with Ron Perlman and owned an apartment on the h floor of Museum Tower.
"After dinner, Harrison invited Samantha up to see his view."
I think you should know my specialty is sexual harassment.
This is a classic case: A classic case of entrapment.
"Beautiful woman, mind altering wine I could claim temporary insanity."
I do have a prior record of driving men a little crazy.
Most sexual harassment cases are brought by older women.
"No offense, but what are you:"
Samantha had celebrated her h birthday for as long as we could remember.
I think you're pretty fresh already.
"There, next to his Brooks Brothers suits was the world's smallest cedar lined den of inequity."
Apparently the view left a little to be desired.
"The next night, Samantha invited us to a party she was throwing for the new coffee table book du jour."
"The book was awful, but the hors d'oeuvres were fabulous."
Takes a lot of work to get rigged up like that.
Most of my first dates don't even open the cab door.
What if he's still hanging there?
"You see, this is why I don't date."
The men out there are freaks.
"If a man is over and single, there's something wrong with him."
They're being weeded out from propagating the species.
You know what the worst part of the date was?
If Samantha's past four birthdays taught me anything it was that there is only one answer to this question.
You don't look a day over
"I just met the most amazing guy, Mitchell Saylor."
"When Charlotte really liked a guy, she said his whole name."
It helped her to imagine their future monogrammed towels.
What is that supposed to mean?
"Ladies, I suggest you join me in the bathroom."
"Suddenly, Charlotte's towels were looking very different."
"He's renowned, he loves going down on women."
He's so cute to be so nasty.
I told you there'd be something.
He's just amazing at eating pussy.
Would you please stop calling it that?
I don't have to talk about it.
"Reality was, the only thing that went down with regularity on Charlotte's dates was a Gold American Express card."
I'm not dating anyone who is known as Mr. Pussy.
Maybe I want more than that.
"Sweetie, if a man is good at that, there is nothing more."
You have to be talking about Mitch Saylor.
I dated him for a month.
"He was so good, I actually passed out when I came."
The guy's got good word of mouth.
"Unlike Miranda, I wasn't ready to accept that all single men were freaks."
"I was so optimistic, I had actually agreed to go on my first blind date in two years."
P.J was a very successful independent movie producer.
His documentary on endangered seagulls had just aired to excellent reviews on PBS.
I'm only doing this docu bullshit to earn a rep.
"Ultimately, I want to parlay into the action movie arena to make money."
I'm not afraid to say it.
I'd sell toilet bowls if it'd make me a millionaire.
Two vodkas and a pasta buys your admission to see The Man With No Soul.
"Observe if you dare, this chilling sight."
"Just so you know, I can't see a movie without popcorn."
I'm a Junior Mints kind of guy.
You want to lean a little closer?
Why don't you and your fucking girlfriend just sit on our laps at the movie?
"Then you won't miss a fucking word, dick"
"Ladies and gentlemen, stand far away from The Man With Two Faces."
They say the third time's the charm.
Max was a broker who made million on bonds last year.
We had a great dinner in Little Italy.
Not only did Max have million he also appeared to have a lending library in his pants.
"Parents, please keep the kiddies away from the cage of The Man Who Steals Cheap Used Books for No Reason."
Apparently the men in the dating world had devolved since the last time I visited.
They never should've outlawed freak shows because at least then the freaks were rounded up in one place.
"Now they're out there among us, roaming free."
Apparently Charlotte's week went a little better than mine.
"On Monday night, she was finally ready to let Mitch under her sheets way under."
That night Charlotte came harder than she ever had before.
"That night, Charlotte saw God seven times."
"For a lapsed Episcopalian, it was a very Good Friday."
"If Mitch was a freak, Charlotte was ready to run away and join the circus."
"Meanwhile, all I wanted to do was run away."
"Last month, I went out with a woman who slept with her shoes on."
But I was pretty sure I could feel webs between his fingers.
So when did you guys all become freaks?
The Shoe Woman seemed totally normal.
"Then a month in, I discover she's a freak."
That's why I don't date anymore.
I once saw the world's fattest twins at a state fair.
Maybe it was an optical illusion.
Would you have dinner with me?
It would be a non date.
Let's call it a non no.
And it was then that the most freaky thing happened.
There in the middle of Manhattan two complete strangers gave out their unlisted phone numbers.
"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to have her own chance encounter."
I had the fat from my ass injected into my face.
"The best part is, you get to eat like a pig before, fatten up your ass and then a week later it's in your face."
"An hour later, Samantha had her first Big Mac and an appointment with the most expensive plastic surgeon on Upper Fifth."
"Meanwhile, I had my own ass to be obsessed with and it belonged to Ben an editor at a hip political magazine, who made me laugh."
Then I guess this is goodnight.
"Normally I'd try to get upstairs, but since this is a non date"
There was nothing non about it.
A week and three non dates later Samantha summoned us to make an announcement.
It's sitting in a fat repository in Queens as we speak.
"And in three days, it will be in my face and I will look fabulous."
We spend our lives trying to hide the fat in our ass and you're putting it right on your face?
I just have to wear this girdle for a week to keep my skin tight.
That's a girdle with a hole.
Of course it has a hole.
Last night I slept with a Calvin Klein model.
I think the fat's already gone to your head.
Could you put your skirt down?
I'm meeting Mitch at my apartment.
I think we have a chance at a future together.
You don't fall in love with Mr.
You enjoy him and then set him free.
"To Samantha, Charlotte had committed the ultimate sin."
"Aside from technique, what do you know about him?"
Have you guys had dinner together?
"Have you seen a play, anything?"
You've fallen into the sex haze.
Where the sex is really great and you start acting like a crazy person.
You imagine the relationship is something it's not.
"Charlotte's not having a relationship, she's having multiple orgasms."
"Hoping to prove Miranda wrong I had convinced her to come out on a double non date with Ben 's friend, Luke."
Things were actually going remarkably well.
I like to see it as traditional.
Nothing makes you feel like more of a non couple than creating another non couple.
"Unfortunately, our smugness was a little premature."
What are you doing this weekend?
I'm gonna go see my granddad in Connecticut.
I haven't left Manhattan in years.
Everything you want is right here.
"Culture, food, the Park, cabs at a.m."
Perhaps to experience a world outside Manhattan.
There is no world outside Manhattan.
I'd unwittingly set Miranda up on a date with Manhattan Guy.
A genetically mutant strain of single men that fed on Zabar's and midnight shows at the Angelica.
I also happen to like the country.
This does not make me a freak.
I have to go feed my cat.
Miranda had invoked our code phrase.
"Honed over years of bad parties, awful dates and unending phone calls."
"Unfortunately, I wasn't ready to accept defeat."
I thought you already fed your cat.
I have to feed it again.
The man has not left Manhattan in a decade.
"And by the way, if Luke is a freak, Ben is bound to be a freak, too."
You can tell everything about a person by who their friends are.
"That night, I couldn't get Miranda's freaky comment out of my head."
Is there anything weird about you I should know before this gets any more compromising?
"Now that you mention it, there is."
It's a souvenir from a drunken bachelor party a few years ago.
"My friend's marriage didn't last, but Tweety Bird did."
I got into a fight with a third grade bully.
And then The Amazing Tattooed Man made love to me.
And it didn't feel weird at all.
While Miranda was busy feeding her pussy Charlotte was trying to do everything but.
Did you ever go to summer camp?
"There, over the exotic fruit plate Charlotte tried to make a relationship happen."
I went to this place in Maine called Minihaha.
We used to play these big games of color war.
And then they made us stop because they said that it glorified warfare.
She had stayed too long at the fair.
"From that moment on, Charlotte couldn't be in the same room with a fig."
Some people might call that a little odd.
"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to get her own special showing."
"To Samantha, surgery was like being at Barneys."
"Once you're in the door, you might as well shop."
We can always lift a little here.
Here In five years we can augment the breasts.
The hip and the thigh area.
"Doctor, you're needed on the phone."
Samantha felt like she had walked into a fun house.
I'm late for my soccer game.
I'll be back in two hours.
We had done it and now I really liked him.
I was deep into the sex haze and completely freaked out.
There had to be something sick and off about him.
"If the rest of the species had devolved, Ben would have to be a freak to survive."
I had to find out what was wrong before I wasted the next six months.
I just wanted to see what the guy ate listened to dated.
Then it took on a life of its own.
"Somewhere in this hip, normal looking apartment was the clue to Ben 's inner freakiness."
And I wasn 't gonna rest until I found it.
Ben 's secret box of freakdom.
"Home of illicit photos, love letters, maybe an old marriage license."
What the hell are you doing?
I guess I was looking for something.
It's my Cub Scout badge collection.
I was gonna skip the game to be with you.
I thought you were actually a normal one.
That was the day I came face to face with my freak.
The frightening woman whose fear ate her sanity.
"The truth is, it isn't just the men."
Anyone who's single in Manhattan gets a little freaked out from time to time.
"But we keep trying, because you have to figure if the world's fattest twins can find love, there's hope for all of us."
"Somewhere out there is another little freak who will love us, understand us and kiss our three heads and make it all better."
"And in the meantime, we always have Manhattan."
"In life, certain events come along so rarely that when they do, special attention must be paid."
"Events like Halley's comet, solar eclipses getting that second latte for free."
One night at a salsa club in very downtown Manhattan four single girlfriends found themselves without a relationship at the exact same time.
"If I end up old and alone, it's all your fault."
"Sweetie, we're all alone, even when we're with men."
"My advice to you, is to embrace that fact slap on some armor and go through life like I do."
Enjoying men but not expecting them to fill you up.
"Excuse me, I was wondering if you'd like to dance."
"Thanks, but tonight it's just us girls."
"I'm William, one of the club owners."
"If you ever feel like a dance, we could have some fun."
"I'm impressed, not dumping us for a guy."
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?
I'm getting my picture taken for the magazine article in the morning.
All press needs to be cleared through me.
They're doing a profile of Manhattan singles and it's called Single and Fabulous.
I'm single and I'm definitely fabulous.
I was picked because Stanford's new boyfriend is the assistant photo editor.
"One drink turned into many, and before I knew it I was dragging my tired, yet single and fabulous ass home at dawn."
I decided my best bet to avoid looking like I'd been up all night was to stay up all morning.
I'm at the photo shoot and everyone's freaking out
I could not get a cab.
"What did you do, let one drag you here?"
"Stop, I was up all night."
I need a coffee the size of my head.
Stanford has told me so much about you.
It's really nice to finally meet you.
"Hello, you're about a fucking month late"
"Don't look at me, you're the one who's about a fucking month late."
"There's gonna be time for makeup, right?"
I wanna do a few test shots before I check the lighting.
Do you mind if I smoke?
I don't care if you shoot up.
I got to bed really late last night.
"And it's my personal belief, I lapsed into a coma."
Being single and fabulous also frees up one's weekends.
Saturdays usually spent browsing with him in Soho are left for practical things like power walking with your single and fabulous girlfriends.
Let's gossip to get our heart rates up.
"Right, I forgot you do that."
"You've got my number, give me a call."
An ophthalmologist I once faked orgasms with.
The idea that Miranda would fake anything stopped me cold.
I only slept with him twice.
The first time I faked it because it was never gonna happen.
The second time I faked it because I did the first time.
"I didn't wanna fake it again, so I just forgot to return his call."
You broke up with an ophthalmologist over that?
"Orgasm, major thing in a relationship?"
Orgasms don't send you Valentine's cards and don't hold your hand in a sad movie.
"No, but if you really like the guy, what's one little moment of versus spending the whole night in bed alone?"
Who's to say that one moment is any more important than when he gets up and pours you a cup of coffee in the morning?
I'll take an orgasm over a cup of French drip Colombian any day.
"For me, it's a toss up."
"Having smoked all my cigarettes during our workout I stopped for fresh supplies when There I was hanging right next to Martha Stewart Living Carrie Bradshaw, dying of embarrassment."
There was no question mark implied.
"I would never agree to be in an article, Single and Fabulous?"
Not after that picture I won't be.
"They did not say, Single and Fabulous?"
Miranda Can't we sue them or something?
I'm all over the city looking like something that got caught in a drain.
But you wanna ask these women: 'How fun will all night club hopping be at '
"Do you know what I say, Fuck them, exclamation point"
"Every couple of years, an article like this surfaces as a cautionary tale to scare young women into marriage."
Filling their lives with an endless parade of decoys and distractions to avoid the painful fact that they're completely alone.
"This piece of trash has nothing, I repeat, nothing to do with us."
"Exactly, we are single and fabulous."
But I had a sneaking suspicion they didn't quite believe it.
"Somehow, the question mark had leapt off my cover and on to each of them."
"Because, within a week Miranda met Josh for old time's sake."
Samantha met William for a dance.
And Charlotte met a deadline head on.
"So, I'm moving to Salt Lake City."
The acting thing in New York is definitely not happening.
I've a chance to get on a Christian soap opera if I move out West.
The Days of our Mormon Lives or some shit.
What'll you do around here without me?
Tom was an out of work actor friend Charlotte had come to depend on to do the occasional male things she needed done around her apartment.
"Because he was an out of work actor, he had a lot of time."
"And because he had a lot of time, he had a lot of tools."
"After I rewire your lamp, I'm out of here."
Unless you have something else you need done.
She decided she wasn't gonna let her Mr.
"While women are certainly no strangers to faking it we faked our hair color, cup size."
"I couldn 't help but wonder, has fear of being alone suddenly raised the bar on faking?"
Are we faking more than orgasms?
Is it better to fake it than be alone?
"My boyfriend and I were really compatible except for one thing: He liked thin, blond, Waspy types."
I think my wife's an idiot.
Every day with her is like a trip to Idiot Island.
I don't tell her how I really feel.
I'm pretty sure she'd leave me.
A glamorous city like New York offers a sea of single and fabulous things for the fabulous and single to do.
"As long as the magazine's on newsstands, I'm not going out in public for fear of being scorned and chased with sticks."
"He climbs on top of her, next thing you know, she's coming."
"No wonder they're lost, they've no idea there's more work involved."
Is he that bad in bed?
"No, he's just He's a guy."
"They can rebuild a jet engine, but when it comes to a woman What's the big mystery?"
"It's my clitoris, not the Sphinx"
I think you just found the title for your autobiography.
They don't come with a manual.
"If I had a son, I'd teach him all about the vagina."
"If you had a son, we'd call social services."
"The other night, he told me he really likes that I can come while he's fucking me."
How can he believe that that's all it takes?
I'm really hating myself right now.
Could you please just tell me why?
"I'm meeting William after work, and then, who knows?"
"From the way he dances, I'm fairly certain I won't have to fake anything."
Wait until you see my club in the Hamptons.
I'm renting a great house in East Hampton.
We can go out on the weekends.
We can go sailing and cook big lobsters.
We can walk on the beach
"At first Samantha listened, fascinated, detached."
"It was rare to hear a man use the we word, so comfortably so early on."
"Or, we could just lay around and do this."
"She lay back, opened up and let the we wash over her."
Guess where I'm spending the summer?
William's renting a house and he's inviting me for the summer.
All the great places are taken by January.
"I mean, early in the relationship."
You should have heard him last night.
"We can cook, we can swim."
"So he's a we guy, who cares?"
We are going to spend the summer in East Hampton.
And the we I'm referring to right now is you and me.
They say that every great actor knows when to stop performing.
"For Miranda, it was that Saturday night at exactly"
"Come with ... oh God, wow."
"Did I do something wrong tonight, because you came every other time."
I didn't exactly come all those other times.
How many of the other times?
Do you have a physical problem or something?
What makes you assume it's me?
"No offense, it's just Nobody I've ever slept with has had to fake it."
"A lot of women fake it and until five minutes ago you didn't know I was faking it, so"
All the women I've slept with have been faking it?
"Nothing, I was just running a list in my head."
A woman's anatomy is a little more complicated I know all about a woman's anatomy.
I run the Marathon for Christ's sake.
Do you know how the clitoris works?
Do you know where it is?
It's about two inches from where you think it is.
"Later that week, I went over to Charlotte's to see some of Tom's handiwork."
"After we finish with the lighting, we'll move to the kitchen."
"First Samantha and now Charlotte went we, we, all about her home."
How will you get all that done before you leave?
I have to go to my place and get a voltmeter.
"When he told me he was leaving, I suddenly had feelings what if he was the one?"
He'd been under my nose the entire time and I'd never even seen him.
I let the almost out of work actor thing get in the way.
He is strong and masculine and he can fix things around the house.
You can't create a relationship with a guy just because he can caulk your tub.
"As I walked home, I couldn't help but wonder when did being alone become the modern day equivalent of being a leper?"
Will Manhattan restaurants soon be divided up into sections?
"Smoking, non smoking, single, non single?"
Then I had a frightening thought.
Maybe I was the one who was faking it.
All these years faking to myself that I was happy being single.
Pity from the man who sells me my Marlboro Lights.
"I decided I wasn 't gonna let a magazine or my friends or the Surgeon General stop me from being who I was: Single and fabulous, exclamation point."
I've been out of commission for four days and there's a new drink?
I invited Stanford to join me at a fabulous party downtown to honor the fabulous conceptual photographer Ellen von Unwerth.
"Unfortunately, he invited his new boyfriend, Nevin von Bitchy."
"Join the club, I hate me, too."
I'm so sorry about the cover.
I had nothing to do with it.
Next week you'll have a coke dealing slumlord on the cover.
You realize you'll have to dump him.
We're getting a summer share in Sagaponack.
While Stanford and I did downtown Samantha was uptown waiting for William at her favorite romantic restaurant.
At first she thought she had the wrong time.
When he still wasn't there No message.
I don't know what's keeping him.
Could you ask the waiter to bring me a red wine?
"She hadn't expected to be caught out in public alone without a book, project, or any of her dining out alone armor."
She had nothing to do but sit and wait for him.
By now she knew that we William wasn 't ever gonna show up.
He was one of those men who faked a future to get what he wanted in the present.
"She felt exposed, vulnerable, like a fool."
I can't believe I fell for some guy's line.
But sometimes you just need to hear we.
Samantha let the Pakistani busboy kiss her.
"After all, he'd been so sweet and attentive with the bread."
"You take me home, you're not alone."
"As Samantha looked into his sweet and hopeful eyes, she realized something."
No matter how much it hurts sometimes it's better to be alone than fake it.
"Meanwhile, downtown, I heard the funniest thing I'd ever heard from a man I just met."
"Take your tired, fabulous ass home."
I want to meet cute guys.
"Everyone here is gay, gay, gay."
He was everything I was looking for that night.
There wasn't quite as much smoke uptown.
Miranda's two day tutorial with her ophthalmologist had turned lovemaking into a kind of naked eye exam.
Maybe we should just try and let it happen for a second.
"Even with all Josh's good intentions, Miranda found herself no closer."
She realized she was not a jet engine.
She was a lot more complicated.
It would never work between them.
She wanted to give him something for learning so much and trying so hard.
She came out of retirement for one final performance.
Wanna go for a ride in my Porsche?
I want a pack of Marlboro Lights.
I looked at myself in the mirror.
What had I been so afraid of all week?
"I was still young, still desirable."
I would never wind up alone.
My question mark staring me right in the face.
"If I went home with him, it'd be the only time I'd ever had sex to validate my life."
"The question mark would no longer be a question, it would be a fact."
"No way, I'm not letting you out."
I think I should go to Salt Lake City.
"She'd realized two days ago, while she had no problem faking orgasms she could never fake intimacy."
I'm not ready to let it go.
He was mostly just sick of New York and needed an excuse to leave.
It was a perfectly timed double fake.
"Under other circumstances, they could've shared a long life together."
"Over the next week, things returned to normal."
Miranda forgot to return Josh 's last call.
Samantha made peace with her feelings about we William.
And Charlotte learned you don 't have to rely on men 's affections to get things fixed around the house.
"As for me, after I was recycled I decided instead of running away from the idea of a life alone I'd better sit down and take that fear to lunch."
"So, I sat there and had a glass of wine alone."
"No books, no man, no friends, no armor no faking."
There are only two times when it's appropriate to wear the little black dress in daylight.
One involves leaving a party way too late.
The other involves leaving the party way too early.
Javier was a hot Cuban designer and the toast of the New York fashion elite.
He was also a good friend.
I had known him since he was Harvey.
Isn't it a little wrong to wear a dead man's design to his own funeral?
"Besides, at I better get some wear out of it."
That's the thing about New York.
You're always more popular when your not around.
"Reminder, honey: This is a funeral, not Friday night at Bond Street."
Is everyone in town invited to this?
You got invited with a guest?
We were supposed to see a show together.
"Apparently, Charlotte and I were the inappropriate ones."
"There it was, Javier's entire new spring line."
It was his best show ever.
"But if anyone asks, it was a gift from the designer."
"Christ, my heels keep getting stuck."
So much for death with dignity.
Look at the number they did on Josephina.
Josephina was Javier's sister and heir apparent to the Javier industry.
In a day she had gone from ugly duckling to Donatella Versace.
Javier would have wanted it that way.
We are asking today that in Javier's memory all donations be made to Javier House a home we are building to house those in the fashion industry who suffer from substance abuse.
I'm gonna help them raise money.
"Forget nice, the mailing list will be priceless."
And I'll have every unlisted number in Manhattan.
You had to give Samantha credit.
One man's death was another woman 's p.r.
"Josephina, I'm Samantha Jones from Samantha Jones Public Relations."
"I was so touched by your speech, that I wanted to"
It's nothing to lose your hat over.
He works on the same block as my gallery.
You picked up a man at a cemetery?
He's handsome and he went to Princeton.
The widower thing is a definite no no.
"No matter how bitchy she was alive, now she's dead and you're the bitch who can't live up to her."
Don't talk about his wife like that.
It's not his fault she died.
"And besides, going through something like that makes him more sensitive."
He's in touch with his emotions.
They've committed and everyone's still alive.
All marriage did was convince him he hated committing.
So I'm the one with the commitment problem?
While we were watching them break ground on Javier's last location Miranda was breaking new ground of her own.
Such a big apartment to buy for just you.
I have a lot of shoes.
Maybe the boyfriend will move in?
I have a son who owns his own business.
just me bought herself her first apartment and promptly took herself out for a drink.
While Miranda was out celebrating her future I was in contemplating my own.
"In a city that moves so fast, you get the Sunday paper on Saturday how did any of us know how much time we had left?"
There was so much I hadn't done.
I hadn't finished painting my bathroom My Visa bill still wasn't paid in full.
"Hell, sometimes I felt like I was barely living."
Just got back from a funeral.
Listen do you want to have dinner some time?
I'd like to have dinner any old time.
Who am I having dinner with?
"In that case, I better check my book."
"Just like that, I had made a Saturday night date with Big."
"In under seconds, we had resuscitated a relationship that had taken six months to die."
"The next day, Samantha set out to break some records of her own."
"You know, I rarely make personal contributions."
We'd love to have you on the Javier House board.
Maybe in this case you can make an exception?
Getting solicited by a woman as beautiful as you.
"Richard Cranwell, senior partner at Bear Sterns philanthropist, playboy."
"Flattery will get you everywhere, Mr."
"In Samantha's case, it was more like a friendly merger."
Perhaps we could discuss Javier House over dinner sometime.
I believe that could be arranged.
Samantha groped Dick Cranwell for the good of all strung out designers everywhere.
"Unfortunately, she was not expecting Sandy Cranwell back early from groping a sweater set at Bendels."
"Apparently, Sandy was not feeling as charitable as her husband."
"Meanwhile, at her mortgage company across town Miranda was having her own troubles closing the deal."
And the down payment's coming from your father?
In the course of one hour Miranda had checked more single women 's boxes than her gynecologist.
"I'm telling you, if I was a single man, none of this would be happening."
"If you were a single man, I'd date you."
"I've got the money, I've got a great job, and I still get, it's just you?"
Buying a place alone means you don't need a man.
"If you own and he still rents, then the power structure is all off."
Men don't want a woman who's too self sufficient.
"I'm sorry, did someone just order a Victorian straight up?"
"I'm sorry, Miss Jones, your card's not accepted."
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
Your card and you are not accepted here.
Samantha had messed with the wrong woman.
Sandy Cranwell practically owned Manhattan and wanted Samantha off it.
Sandy Cranwell had done what any well heeled socialite would do.
She took out a social hit on Samantha.
"In hours, Sam had gone from a list to blacklist."
"The next night, Charlotte met Ned the widower for drinks."
Maybe we could meet for a real meal next time.
"They talked about architecture, art, the Ivy League."
The ex wife wasn 't even in the picture Is this her?
until the ex wife's picture showed up.
"Let's get out of here, okay?"
That was really thoughtless of me.
I know this must be hard for you.
It's just a little weird talking about her on a date.
"It's just Seeing Liz's picture and thinking about her Oh, God"
"Ordinarily, Charlotte hated when men cried."
"But on Ned, it only made him more romantic."
I'm just feeling so much right now.
Those were magic words to Charlotte's ears.
You just take as much time as you need.
"Apparently, all the time Ned needed was minutes."
"That night, under the watchful eyes of a dead woman Ned came back to life twice."
Not when the other person's dead.
I'm helping him to get over his wife.
This guy has project written all over him.
"It was like Liz was looking over us, giving us her blessing."
"I mean, my hat blew right into her headstone."
She was clearly sending a message.
"Yeah, don't fuck my husband, you hat Ioving bitch."
He invited me to a memorial service at her grave next week.
"Excuse me, but when did cemeteries get so happening?"
It's a sign that he's ready to move on.And he's ready to do it with me.
You're saying you fucked him back to life?
That night I had my date with Big.
"I was feeling everything fear, happiness, dread."
Was I ready to jump back into a life with Big in it?
Was seeing him again a huge mistake?
And if it was why was I so excited?
I had never felt so confused.
In a world where everyone's dying to make a connection can a relationship bring you back to life?
I never really thought about it.
"Come on, everybody wonders what happens after you die."
I'm too busy wondering who's dinging my car in the garage.
What are you gonna come back as?
"And they're just saying, Come on in."
You're idea of heaven is a bed?
It depends on who's in it.
I'm not sleeping with you tonight.
I thought we were just having dinner.
"A half hour later, and I was back at Big's, the site of so many past little deaths."
It felt great and weird and wrong.
"I didn 't know what had happened but suddenly, getting back together with Big seemed like a very bad idea."
"The first time we got involved, I got out just in time."
Would I be as lucky the second?
"Across town, Samantha was facing her own uncertain future."
"The first time, she thought it was an unfortunate oversight."
The second time was just unfortunate.
"By the third time she was turned away, it had all become clear."
She was deader in this town than Javier.
"Teddy, take her out of here."
"The next day, Miranda met her new neighbor."
I haven't actually moved in yet.
I'm so glad to have a young person moving in.
Brings a little life to the place.
Ruthie kept pretty much to herself.
"She died in there, you know."
It was a week before anyone realized she passed.
"Rumor has it, the cat ate half her face."
"That night, Miranda had another disconcerting experience."
Halfway through her Three Delicacy Delight a delicacy got stuck.
After Miranda was done saving her own life she called someone who could commiserate.
"Unfortunately, I was deep into screening mode."
Big had called twice and I didn't know what I wanted to say to him.
"Oh my God, I just choked"
I just almost died and you are not
"I was watching Hard Copy, and I kept thinking when they found me I would forever be the dead girl who watched bad TV."
Do you want me to come over?
"The fact was, Miranda was not okay."
She went to bed hungry and locked the cat in the kitchen for two days.
"After a week of being a social pariah Samantha realized if she ever wanted to get her life back, she'd have to beg for it."
"She went to the top, the Godfather."
Shippy Shipman was the queen of the ladies who lunch.
And was personally responsible for the demise of at least social lives.
You might know me from the Javier House Foundation?
I believe you were the whore who once groped my husband at a Whitney benefit.
Not only was Samantha dying but her entire sex life was flashing before her.
You're good friends with Sandy Cranwell?
"Yes, we go back to Chapin."
Could you maybe talk to her for me?
I think you made your own bed and you need to lie in it.
"And you're good at that, aren't you, Samantha?"
"What do you want me to say, Shippy?"
That I've slept with every man in New York and some in Brooklyn?
Is that what it's gonna take?
And I only groped your husband's flat preppy ass at that benefit because I was drunk.
"The next day, Miranda decided to check out her new neighborhood."
"But suddenly, she was the one checking out."
That was the peculiar thing about New York you never knew if a cab was going to save you or kill you
I felt like I was drowning and dying at the same time.
They said you had a panic attack.
"Yeah, and I had to pay of my single person's salary to find that out."
"Take a good look at my face, because at my funeral there'll only be half of it."
I'll be dead and my cat will be happy.
Charlotte will be picking up men at the next grave site over.
The first people on my call in case of emergency list are my parents.
"Sweetie, you can put me on there."
Listen you did the right thing buying that apartment.
And you won't be alone forever.
"The truth was, I didn't know if any of us would end up alone."
But I did know Miranda couldn't afford another panic attack.
"Meanwhile, over in Queens Charlotte was about to get a surprise of her own."
You said they were her favorite.
Please tell me those are your sisters.
Charlotte realized she wasn't the only woman resuscitating Ned.
Charlotte's relationship died right where it started.
She was prepared to live in the shadow of a dead woman.
She wasn 't prepared to live in the shadow of three live ones.
"That Saturday, Samantha hit rock bottom also known as Javier House."
No one would return her phone calls.
She hadn 't raised any money.
All she could do for Javier House was construct it.
"But six hours of hard labor later, Samantha experienced her own rebirth."
"It was Leonardo DiCaprio, ex machina."
"That day, Leonardo and Samantha became fast friends."
Leonardo DiCaprio had brought Sam back to social life.
To add insult to panic attack Miranda had just gotten some unsettling news.
The mortgage officer had messed up Miranda's application.
They had inadvertently labeled her as separated.
And to clear up the confusion Miranda had to write a rather humiliating letter.
She could panic or she could just type.
Miranda killed her panic attacks right then and there.
She realized she probably wouldn't die alone.
But she kept overfeeding her cat just in case.
"Meanwhile, four unreturned calls later, my number was up."
I had box seats to a Yankee double header.
"It was deja vu all over again: Me, Big, a doorway and mixed emotions."
I took him to the most non sexual place I could think of.
"Two pitchers of cheap beer later, Big and I were having a great time."
You know what my version of hell is?
You want to play a second game?
Are you sure you're ready to get killed all over again?
I didn't know what we were talking about anymore.
"But either way, I knew the answer."
We never made it to the second game.
I didn't know if it was suicide or not.
All I knew was Big and I had been reincarnated and I'd never felt more alive.
They say that New Yorkers will attend the opening of an envelope as long as the champagne doesn't run dry.
"But tonight's opening at Charlotte's gallery for Yael a lesbian painter from Brooklyn Heights actually transcended the bad wine, stale cheese routine."
It was lesbian chic meets art world cool.
A surprisingly fabulous combustion that no one saw coming.
"Charlotte was there with her latest fling, Gareth Davis."
"A toxic bachelor and the owner of Thorn, a downtown restaurant frequented by second tier models and the men who buy them salad."
Miranda brought Ethan Watson a documentary filmmaker she had met the week before at a sparsely attended Harvard Alumni mixer.
And my date for the evening was Samantha.
Not entirely inappropriate given the circumstances.
Nobody told me it was B.Y.O.Man
But don't straight guys follow them around to see what they're going to do?
He's a trainer at my gym.
And you should see his squat thrusts.
I think I'm gonna go home.
"With Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte all suitably occupied I figured there was no better time to make my escape."
"The truth was, I had another engagement."
But I didn't dare tell any of my friends where I was going or who I was planning to meet.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Seeing an emotionally unavailable man I had sworn off months earlier.
But the guilt worked like an aphrodisiac.
I had never felt sexier or more alive in my entire life.
"By midnight, Charlotte discovered Manhattan 's latest group to flaunt their disposable income: The power lesbian."
"Great shoes, killer eyewear and the secrets to invisible makeup."
Didn't I say I was buying it?
I thought you were taking the large one.
Charlotte had never sold out a show before in her life.
"Unfortunately, there was a not so pleasant surprise in store for her."
I'm sure I have an extra case or two in the back storeroom.
I can't believe he had the nerve to kiss her and still pretend he wasn't cheating.
Maybe he doesn't consider kissing cheating.
It was only your second date.
Doesn't that guarantee me fidelity until the end of the evening?
"Remember Ron, the married guy with kids on Park Avenue?"
He didn't consider fucking below d Street cheating.
Men cheat for the same reason that dogs lick their balls: Because they can.
Instead of wasting all this energy condemning it maybe it's time we all got in line with the reality of the situation.
"That sounds very empowering, but you're forgetting one detail."
We don't go around randomly attacking any man we're attracted to.
Then what does drive us according to you?
"I mean that little voice inside of me that says, Mate for life."
You can't listen to every fucking little voice that runs through your head.
The problem is that you two have very different definitions of cheating.
And I'm more forgiving and realistic about human nature.
I just don't think that you can define cheating in absolute terms.
You think it's okay to cheat?
I think maybe there's a cheating curve.
Someone's definition of what constitutes cheating is in direct proportion to how much they themselves want to cheat.
I prefer to think of it as quantum cheating.
"The fact is, the act of cheating is defined by the act of getting caught."
One doesn't exist without the other.
Is cheating like the proverbial tree in the forest?
That it doesn't exist if there's no one around to catch you?
"In a gravity free world of anything goes, what constitutes cheating?"
That's the great thing about having a trainer.
Pisses me off seeing people train improperly.
I guess I better behave then.
I'm all about form and discipline.
Do it right or don't bother doing it at all.
Samantha realized that while purity of form exacted a price it also had its own rewards.
"Later that day, Charlotte realized she was tired of listening to another man 's weak justifications."
She's a friend of my sister's from college.
She just moved to the city and her uncle died last month.
I was just trying to be supportive.
Besides you're the one I want to sleep with.
When she felt her life take a fortuitous turn.
I just came in to pay for my painting.
It's her painting for six months and then she's selling it back to me.
I'm the one with the big loft and all the empty white walls.
"By the way, I love the Prada loafers."
Power lesbians and their shoes are like Wall Street brokers and their cigars.
Alice told me so many nice things about you.
How long have you been doing the art thing?
Almost five years at this gallery.
How long have you been together?
Want to join Melissa and Drew in about an hour for a drink?
Would you like to join us for a drink?
The truth is Charlotte couldn't think of one really good reason not to go.
"One drink at G Spot, the hottest new girl bar in town followed by dinner and scintillating conversation at Luke's a hot new French fusion restaurant with an even hotter chef followed by late night dancing at Love Tunnel left Charlotte exhilarated and happy as she'd been in ages."
There was something relaxing and liberating in traveling in an alternate universe that contained no thought of men.
"By the end of the night, Charlotte had truly made some wonderful new friends."
"That night, Miranda was exhausted from her own night on the town."
She had spent the last four hours in the dark with Ethan watching the classic holocaust documentary Shoah.
"Shoah is so much better than that faky, stagy Schindler's List."
Narrative film can't begin to touch the horror of experience.
Only documentaries can really begin to capture the truth.
"In fact, the entire concept of narrative film is just bogus."
You know Want to come back to my place?
Miranda was pleased to discover that Ethan was as passionate in bed as he was on the subject of non narrative film.
But just as they were getting down to business Miranda realized they were not alone.
Just something to get us in the mood.
"I think it's kind of sexy, don't you?"
"Yeah, I guess it could be."
Miranda realized that Ethan's passion for film had taken on a new and interesting twist.
"A few nights later, after a late show of Gimme Shelter at the Waverly Miranda discovered that Ethan's new friends were hard to shake."
Does that really need to be on?
It just really turns me on.
I can turn off the sound if it bugs you.
Could you move your head a bit to the right?
"Big's kitchen, I performed an unnatural act of my own."
And tore up little pieces of bread.
It's the only recipe I could ever master.
Now tell me you love it.
Can we go to a restaurant now?
I haven't told my friends we're seeing each other.
I sensed you didn't want me to.
What do you want me to tell people?
Why do you want to keep it quiet?
I just want to be agreeable.
"The truth is, I wasn't sure why I wanted to keep the fact that I was seeing Big again so under wraps."
All I knew is that it felt somehow illicit.
I didn 't even want to be caught waking up there.
M as I walked the Walk of Shame back to my apartment
What are you doing up here?
I like to get it over with.
"It was kind of sexy at first, but it's getting borderline humiliating."
Isn't the real thing more exciting than a tape?
Maybe it's a force of habit.
I get the feeling he's more interested in the video than me.
Like he's cheating on me with them while we're having sex.
"No, you deserve his undivided attention."
You're dressed up for the dentist
I had never lied to Miranda before.
But I was embarrassed to admit that I was seeing Big again.
"The truth was, I was cheating on her and all my friends with Mr."
"That afternoon, Samantha got very personal with her new trainer, Thor."
I feel like such a cliche.
I bet you sleep with all your clients.
"I really don't, but it's always been kind of a fantasy for me."
Why don't we take a shower first?
"If I knew we were going to be doing this, I'd have shaved them."
I guess that depends on your definition of dirty.
And then to Samantha's surprise and delight Thor kept right on shaving.
What is this thing guys have these days about wanting to shave your pubic hair?
"Actually, in Thor's case, it was more like being branded."
He shaved me in a shape: A lightning bolt.
Where do you find these guys?
"Carrie, are you listening to this?"
That very personal trainer of Samantha's shaved her crotch in the shape of a lightening bolt.
Sort of like X marks the spot.
"You know, it's a very neglected area."
But people are really starting to pay attention.
You can't just let it grow wild.
There's an entire business devoted to the upkeep and management of pubic hair.
It says as much about you as shoes.
"Congratulations, it sounds like you found yourself a very talented stylist."
Carrie What are you doing in there?
I'll be out in a sec.
You didn't have to get all dressed up for us.
I'm meeting Lydia and her friends tonight.
I just have some new lesbian friends.
She's been out with them three times this past week.
They're cool and they buy art and their lives aren't complicated by men.
I was a major lesbian in the fourth grade.
"I'm sure they do, but we don't even talk about sex."
"You have to tell them, otherwise you're just leading them on."
You're nothing but a big clit tease.
Are you saying that a straight woman and a gay woman can't be friends?
"Of course, but you can't expect to move to Wonder Woman's island and not go native."
"If she doesn't get out of the bathroom, we'll miss the movie."
I got a new diaphragm and it's stuck.
How long has it been in there?
While you were getting your teeth cleaned this morning it was
I'm either gonna have to make an emergency visit to my gynecologist or someone's gonna have to help me.
"I'd help you, but I'm not very dexterous."
"You're the lesbian, go in there."
And I just had my nails done.
You are so buying me dinner.
Aren't we skipping a beat here?
It's something that started again a few weeks ago.
I don't know if it's real so I didn't want to say anything.
He was such an asshole to you.
Why do you think it'll be different this time?
"I'm not sure they are, but it kind of feels okay."
"If it feels okay, why are you sneaking around?"
"We've got this physical, chemical kind of connection that's hard to shake."
Now it's gonna be a casual sex thing?
Even I am not that naive.
I'm really not in the mood to see a movie anymore.
I couldn't sleep at all that night.
"The problem was, my friends were right."
"Falling into this casual thing with Big, without a sense of what happened or where it was going, suddenly felt like a huge mistake."
"The next morning, Charlotte attended brunch at the home of Patty Aston the ex wife of a Hollywood television producer."
If power lesbians represented Manhattan 's chicest new social hive Charlotte was about to meet their queen bee.
She's on the board of charities and now she's taking flying lessons.
She's got a house in Telluride.
We're all going there for Easter.
She also has some very interesting art.
I've heard so many wonderful things about you.
I was telling Charlotte about your amazing house in Telluride.
I'm gonna get us some drinks.
I guess I'm what you'd call a snow bunny.
I just kind of hop down the bunny trail.
"It's not a prerequisite, believe me."
It's wonderful to leave the city and be in the mountains.
You should plan to join us the next time.
I know Lydia would love it if you could.
"But before we get on a plane together, there's something we all want to know."
But I do so enjoy the company of all these women.
"After spending too much time and attention on men it feels like such a safe, warm environment."
"And while sexually, I feel that I am straight there's a very powerful part of me that connects to the female spirit."
"Sweetheart, that's all very nice but if you're not going to eat pussy, you're not a dyke."
"Later that afternoon, following a particularly grueling workout with Thor Samantha decided to take a relaxing steam."
That day at the gym Samantha discovered that lightning does indeed strike twice.
"That evening, Miranda was treated to a double bill."
Nanook of the North at Alice Tully Hall and Steady as She Blows at Ethan Watson's Porn Palace.
This is not a synchronized event.
It's either the women in the video or me.
"Your choice, but you can't have both."
I've only known you for a few weeks.
But I've been involved with these women for years.
I am so out of here.
"That night, for the first time ever, Big took me out dancing."
It was like he knew I needed to talk to him and decided to make it as difficult as possible.
"Our attraction, or addiction, or whatever, was strong."
But I knew I had to be stronger.
Does this mean we're seeing each other again?
I don't know what officially means.
"Every moment of my life is for real, baby."
Just answer me this: Why did we break up?
You're the one who left me high and dry with two tickets to St.
You didn't say what I wanted to hear.
I wanted to tell him I was afraid he could never love me the way I wanted to be loved.
I was afraid that he didn't really have the capacity to love anyone but himself.
"I was afraid that, given the chance, he'd break my heart again."
But I cheated and just said I guess I was afraid.
I can tell you one thing.
I sure did miss you officially.
But I did listen to a hell of a lot of Sinatra.
I guess we were back together officially.
There are over seven million people in New York not including houseguests.
Visitors are a vital part of the city's economy.
Most single people in Manhattan do not buy furniture or hang pictures until the arrival of an out of towner.
"Everything in Miranda's new apartment was hand picked, finished and arranged by Charlotte's friend, Madeline Dunn, an up and coming interior designer."
I've been looking for one of those.
That's very stylish for a pullout.
I'll have that end table for you tomorrow.
That's what started this whole thing.
I needed a sofa bed for Jeremy.
If he actually sleeps on it while staying in my fabulous apartment l'll throw myself out a window treatment.
Jeremy was an old friend of Miranda's who'd been in London writing for The Economist.
He was coming to New York to scope out the job situation.
"Miranda suggested he be her houseguest, because his e mails, always entertaining had started to border on flirtatious."
"Meanwhile, I had become a frequent houseguest of Big's."
Do you have a spare toothbrush I could use?
I'll bring you a new one.
There's only one pink brush head and Big was giving his to me.
It was the most encouraging moment so far in our relationship.
He was more adorable than Miranda remembered.
That must be my end table.
My end table is afraid to go out alone.
I hope you like the finish.
It's a hair darker than I was thinking.
We were just about to get some dinner.
Did you want to join us?
"Last week, I was doing an interview at a restaurant in Kensington"
Miranda found herself in the situation every woman dreams of She was on a truly great first date.
just be careful not to eat any buckshot
I slept on the plane for once.
"Go ahead, I can find my way back."
We don't have to Except I forgot to make a copy of the key.
"I was at the same restaurant A week later, Miranda threw Jeremy a going away party."
"I'd like to make a toast to my good friend Miranda who not only put me up, she threw this soir??e in celebration of my departure."
"I'd especially like to thank her for introducing me to Madeline an incredible, beautiful woman who must be drunk off her ass because she just agreed to marry me."
"Apparently, the only thing going away was Miranda's dream."
"Everyone says, as soon as you get your own place, someone will propose."
I thought it would be to me.
"At the least, she owes you a mortgage payment."
This is two people justifying a week of non stop fucking.
"Even if you're not dating anybody, you could be engaged in a couple of weeks."
Or you could be dating someone for a year and be thrilled to get an electric toothbrush head.
I don't understand why women are so obsessed about getting married.
Married people just want to be single again.
"If you're single, the world is your smorgasbord."
Can you tell me if this is where Jeremy Fields's engagement party is?
"It's the red awning, and it's a going away party."
Were you going to the party?
I was leaving the party because there were no handsome men there.
My apartment is lucky for everybody but me.
What apartment isn't lucky for Samantha?
I could've hired a nice gay decorator and none of this would've happened.
Madeline and Jeremy might've never met.
"Yes, and Jeremy would've fallen in love with me."
"That night, I needed a little reality check."
I was just at this party and two people who met a week ago announced their engagement.
These people think they're soul mates.
Did they actually use the term soul mates ?
"Then, I give them three months."
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I believe in lust at first sight.
"Come on, I need a visual."
"I don't know, a top, strapless."
Were you asleep when I called?
"But next time, be at the door naked."
In a city as cynical as New York is it still possible to believe in love at first sight?
I'd completely given up on the idea.
"Now I know, the ones who don't believe in love at first sight have never experienced it."
Love at first sight is for Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman.
It's too flaky for New York.
"Here, women want a blood test and an ATM receipt before you get their number."
How can you believe in love at first sight in a city where people jerk off on you in the subway?
A bride four weeks from her wedding doesn't have time to have a coffee.
"So, I joined Madeline for a mind boggling hour in the presence of absolute certainty."
"I'd like each bridesmaid to carry a different flower: Tulips, irises, lilies, Gerber daisies."
Did she say she's one of my bridesmaids?
I've asked Miranda to do the guest books since she introduced us.
"Carrie, I'm such a fan of your column."
Would you consider writing something to read at our wedding?
What does she want you to write?
"Dear God, I hope you said no."
How can you say no to somebody who wants you to be involved in their wedding?
"If I knew, I wouldn't be in charge of the guest book."
Why did I agree to this?
"I write about sex, not love."
What do I know about love?
I might have to get married.
The guy I picked up at Miranda's
"If you're engaged, I'm selling the apartment."
We went back to my place.
She was having a d??j? fuck.
Why the hell didn't you say something?
I thought you were playing the sexy stranger game.
So it was kind of a reunion.
How could you forget someone you slept with?
"Toto, we're not in single digits anymore."
It's not like you shared a cab with this guy.
Maybe we did it in a cab.
I'd like to forget some I've slept with.
"How sweet, Men to Do Today ."
I'm officially out of men to fuck.
I have to get married or move.
Can I use that in my poem?
Wait till you see my bridesmaid's dress.
"No, we got to pick our own."
It's this amazing backless black satin.
"All Madeline said was, it had to be black"
I've been tasteful and appropriate at seven other weddings.
"I'm always: Charlotte, Don't Look at Me, Look at the Bride"
"This time, people are gonna look at me"
"For some reason, this whirlwind wedding was extremely stressful for everyone but the bride and groom."
"The next night, I made the mistake of telling Big about the poem."
"Love, glove, dove Dove is good."
Love is like a dove Or big fuzzy glove Don't use that.
I might have stolen it from a greeting card.
It's not supposed to be fun.
A wedding is serious to some people.
"I wouldn't miss you reciting Love, glove, dove in front of all New York for anything."
He was going with me to a wedding.
I left the card here for you to sign.
"They're not my friends and your name's on the invitation, too."
"It was my first time to get something other than, Carrie Bradshaw and Guest."
"Whatever, if you don't want to sign it's not a big deal."
Would you like to sign the guest book?
Would you like to sign the guest book?
Would you like to sign the guest book?
At least we get to see who's arriving alone.
Samantha could always be counted on to take life's lemons and make them into Spanish fly.
Do you know where the gifts go?
"Excuse me, I'm not the gift person."
"Of course, you met him at the engagement party."
I have to start writing things down.
I also have to start drinking heavily.
Should I be bothered by the fact he wouldn't sign the card?
I'm glad I didn't ask him to sign the guest book.
That would've put him over the edge.
Charlotte wasn't kidding about the dress.
It was hard not to notice her.
"My gosh, I am so late."
Are you with the bride or the groom?
"I'm Martin, I'll be walking you down the aisle."
"All her life, Charlotte had imagined doing exactly that with someone like Martin."
I'll show you where you're supposed to be.
I've been here half an hour.
"While Miranda was feeling invisible, I was feeling far too visible."
I barely know the bride and groom.
I'm between the vows and the fish course.
Can you leave the guest book unattended?
"The ceremony was short and sweet, just like the engagement."
"It took her months to find an end table, she plans a wedding at the Plaza in four weeks."
Five bucks says that your end table will last longer than her marriage.
People have said a lot of nice things about Jeremy and I'm here to make a rebuttal.
"Seriously, I've known Jeremy a long time"
Which is more than the bride could say.
"I only hope that someday I can have what you two have little napkins with my name on them and, of course, someone to love."
Now we have a very special treat.
"One of my favorite writers, Carrie Bradshaw has agreed to share a poem that she wrote for the occasion."
"As I made my way to the microphone, I could only think of one thing Dead Woman Walking."
"His hello was the end of her endings Her laugh was their first step down the aisle His hand would be hers to hold forever His forever was as simple as her smile Suddenly, it hit me."
Two people were committing to a life together and I couldn't even get a guy to be on a card with me.
"He said she was what was missing She said instantly she knew She was a question to be answered And His answer was, 'I do ' I had no choice but to embrace the moment and try to pass off my tears as tears of joy for the happy couple."
Charlotte Can I have the salad dressing?
"I want three or four kids, too."
Where to you stand on dog vs.
"You know, I think this should be our song."
"What, are they on the Evelyn Wood plan, too?"
I had to take a call.
You missed my poem and most of the reception.
There's nothing like a slow dance to make you forgive and forget.
I hate to dance when people are eating.
I'll be at the bar where people are drinking.
I think I know you from somewhere.
"No, I think I know you from college."
"Then, we probably fucked in college."
"It's the famous poet, Carrie Bradshaw."
Can we not talk about the poem?
Big took a call during my poem.
The Guest Book Person is also the Put the Gifts in the Van Person.
"Do you want to help, or should I go outside and wait for someone else not to see me so I can end it?"
What street do you want to stand in?
"If they get married within a month, I'm not going."
Even while on the verge of breaking the land speed record for relationships Charlotte took her duties as bridesmaid very seriously.
We just throw Silly String around and write funny things on the mirror in lipstick.
"Some people throw condoms on the bed, but I prefer rose petals."
I would love to wake up in rose petals.
"The bed, the rose petals the bed Technically, it wasn't a third date but they'd already had dinner and been dancing."
"Twenty minutes later, Charlotte worried she'd made a rookie mistake by sleeping with a man she might marry."
I want to introduce you to my parents.
Meeting the parents Charlotte was back on schedule.
We've been dancing up a storm.
Would you like a free lesson?
My dad considers himself quite a dancer.
He's pretty much my role model.
He used to take me to his office when I was little.
Your father just felt me up.
We were dancing and he put his hand
My parents have been married for years.
My dad would not cop a feel just because some girl is wearing a slutty dress.
"Suddenly, it was clear to Charlotte that Martin wouldn't take her side now or after three or four kids, or ever."
Did the last four and a half hours mean nothing to you?
"Darn, we missed the chicken dance."
"Excuse me, have you seen my date?"
"I'm sorry, I had to help Miranda put the gifts into the van."
Have they even cut the cake yet?
"I don't know, but I can tell you how it turns out."
"If you want to go, go."
You wouldn't even sign the card.
I'm afraid we don't want the same things.
I want someone who's going to be with me until the end of a wedding.
It's time for the tossing of the bouquet.
Isn't the bouquet toss at the end?
I want to say goodbye to my friends.
He's crossed his pain threshold and he's carrying me along.
Some people know they're meant to be together.
I knew I was meant to go home and have cake in bed with Big.
Maybe we're more the fuzzy glove types.
Once upon a second time around in a mythical land between Carmine and Mulberry streets two mere mortals were having a wonderful time.
This is the gangster I was telling you about.
You've never called me your girlfriend before.
"And now you wise guy, come on, it's your turn."
I'd like to dedicate this song to the lovely lady sitting right over there.
When I was It was a very good year It was a very good year For small town girls and soft summer nights We'd hide from the lights In the village green When I was It was perfect.
I felt like I was in heaven.
"Meanwhile across town, Miranda was in hell"
or its modern day equivalent: The comedy club.
I've never been this close to suicide.
If you ditch me in this place I will hunt you down and kill you.
Alan Miller was a divorced architect she met in aisle three at the Food Emporium.
They immediately bonded over a shared hatred of designer croutons.
If all I was interested in was freshness then I would be fucking my salad crisper
You wanna answer your fuckin' phone?
"I'm sorry, his date can't speak right now."
Whom may I say is calling?
"Numb nuts, your wife's on the phone."
You told me you were divorced.
"Honey If they're not married, they're gay, or burned from a divorce or aliens from the planet Don't date me."
It's amazing how many of them walk among us.
Only recognizable by their slightly larger heads.
"I asked him, point blank: How long have you been divorced?"
And of them can't fuck you worth a damn
"He tells me how much he likes me, and boom, I believe him."
Maybe he really did like you.
If you Pollyanna out on me today I'll have to hit you with this rice pudding.
"This married man fell madly in love with my friend, Amanda's friend, Ashley and he said he would get a divorce and he did."
"They got married, moved to Connecticut and he is this amazing husband and father."
Unbelievable fairy tales concocted by women to make their love lives seem less hopeless.
"Except it makes you feel even more hopeless because this fabulous, magical relationship is never happening to you."
Like the one about the guy who couldn't commit and the woman broke up with him and moved to Kansas.
"One night, she comes walking home"
He stands there in front of her door with an engagement ring.
"He says, Marry me, and they live happily ever after."
People do live happily ever after.
"It happened to my friend, Amanda's friend."
It's always a friend who knows a friend Charlotte Honey.
Have you ever known anyone who's relationship changed magically overnight?
Their relationship is totally different than before.
"I can, but you're so scary right now, I won't."
Something shifted Maybe we both know that if we came together again it must be for a reason.
Why is that so hard to believe?
How much time have you got?
"That afternoon, I got to thinking about myths and relationships."
The primitive Greeks clung desperately to myths to explain the random hopelessness of their miserable lives.
Do modern day singles need modern day myths just to help us get through our random and sometimes miserable relationships?
"After what seemed like an eternity of not quite fitting together, we suddenly fit."
Or was that something I desperately needed to believe?
Are we willing to believe anything to date?
While Samantha had little belief in the idea of happily ever after she had a strong belief in the idea of a smart cocktail at the end of the work day.
"Samantha, a Cosmopolitan and Donald Trump."
You don't get more New York than that.
I'll be at my office at Trump Tower.
I was so distracted by your beauty I think I just agreed to finance Mr.
May I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you an island?
"So, Samantha, do you come here often?"
"Honey, that line's older than you are."
"A bottle of their best champagne later Samantha had learned that Ed was single, available and a millionaire many, many times over."
What's your age ceiling with men?
Factor in millions and millions of dollars.
"Well, I just met the cutest older man."
He took me to dinner at Jean Georges.
"We got right in, no reservation needed."
I wasn't aware that Jean Georges had an early bird special.
He's vibrant and powerful and generous.
He's just looking for someone to have a little fun with.
Are you telling me that you are seriously capable of having sex with a senior?
You know the saying: All cats look the same in the dark.
"Alligators in the sewer, pets in the microwave and now an old man and Samantha."
Is this a piece of veal or is this a piece of veal?
That is a piece of veal.
"In every myth, there comes a point when the mere mortals are given a test."
The way they respond usually determines whether they find paradise or are tied to a big rock for all eternity.
I want you to know my friends better.
I want them to know you better.
They've never really spent time with you and you're so funny and cute.
Carrie What is it you need?
I want us all to have dinner Saturday night at Denial.
Denial was a very popular Manhattan hot spot.
"Apparently, everyone in Manhattan wanted to be in Denial."
Didn't you get the message I left on your machine an hour ago?
I thought you were dead or something.
You and I are having dinner tonight.
You blew me off for a piece of politically incorrect meat?
"Well, he wanted to make me dinner."
You just dropped your life and ran right on over to his?
I can't get into that right now.
You're relationship is the same as always.
"Could you put Miranda on, please?"
I'll have another glass of wine.
"I'll have another glass of wine, please."
Are you allowed to talk to me like that?
That's really very cute but I'm not in the mood.
"I'm not really in the mood, Steve."
"I'm not a total bitch, I just had a fight with somebody."
"Slow down, that's a nice Cotes du Rhone."
"A bribe, so, you'll hang out and talk."
"If you leave, I'll have to listen to those NYU kids with the Amstel Lights discuss Fiona Apple."
They did a little more than talk.
"After work they went back to her place where Steve, the bartender served Miranda two orgasms, straight up."
Is that your shirt over there?
Can I get your phone number?
To call you up and ask you for a date.
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to make believe you're gonna call.
Let's just call this what this was: A one night stand.
"Stop by the bar, see me sometime."
Three dinners and two extravagant lunches later Ed invited Samantha over to his townhouse.
"Up until now, she would never have believed she would consider a relationship with an older man."
Bu there was something about Ed.
After an impressive six course dinner Ed put the moves on Samantha.
Ed's moves were from a different dating time.
Moves she had heard of or seen in old movies but moves she never thought she'd experience firsthand.
I used to groove with these cats in Cuba.
I'm gonna lay my cards on the table.
I've only got a handful of good years left.
I'm looking for someone to have some fun with.
I'm aware that a gorgeous woman like you can get any young man you want.
I'm willing to make it worth your wild.
And speaking of wild don't worry.
"I got a big, old pocketful of Viagra."
Samantha was suddenly living her own urban relationship myth.
The woman who stopped for a cocktail after work and lived happily ever after.
I think in the dark is sexier.
Could you get that light behind you?
"In the dark, she learned that all cats not only look the same but felt the same."
Ed's lips were not the lips of an older man.
Ed's touch was not the touch of an older man.
Unfortunately Ed's ass was the ass of an older man.
She told him it was a bad reaction to the shellfish from dinner.
"Saturday afternoon, Miranda was at home enjoying a cup of coffee and her New York Times when fate came knocking."
You want your neighbors to hear?
"No, I didn't have your number and I wanted to tell you something."
Translation: I think you're an easy lay and I'd like to have sex again.
"I don't know, because we're hungry."
I can't have dinner with you.
"Quick, before you make one up."
I'm meeting my friends downtown at Denial for dinner.
I'll meet you for a drink.
What time are you really meeting them?
One quick drink and we'd be out the door.
I told myself all day it was just another dinner with friends.
"But, as I stood waiting, in my new, very favorite dress I realized it meant a lot more."
"You're not properly attired to meet my friends, mister."
About that Do you mind if I don't go?
"I've been out all day, it's gonna rain."
But my friends are expecting you.
"I know, but they're your friends and they'll be fine with just you."
I was afraid if I looked up into his eyes I'd turn to stone.
How could I have let myself believe things would be different the second time around?
"I'd never heard of a myth in which a self centered, year old baby magically transformed into a grown man that you could bring out in public."
They won't seat us 'til all of our party is here.
How long do you think Big will be?
"I'm not sure, he's coming from work."
I didn't have the strength to tell them about my fallen hero.
"I figured as long as I was in Denial, I might as well stay there."
"If you want good service, send a bartender."
"If you want a good fuck, go home with one."
"Miranda Can I talk to you over there, for a second?"
The gods are punishing me for having casual sex.
One quick question and I'm out of here.
Why do you hate guys so much?
"We just met, so I know that it ain't all about me."
I just wanna get to know you better.
"Can you, for a second, believe that maybe I'm not some full of shit guy?"
That maybe I do like you?
That maybe the other night was special?
Do you think maybe you can believe that?
Maybe I've just slept with too many bartenders.
I don't wanna talk about it.
"Nice meeting you all, excuse me."
Maybe we should get a table for four.
I didn't know if I had the heart to tell Charlotte that happily ever after really was just a myth.
It's really coming down out there.
Seeing Big show up for me shook Miranda's lack of belief system to the very core.
"Just like that, Miranda left Denial."
"From that night on, promiscuous women everywhere would tell the tale of the one night stand that turned into a relationship."
Did you ever get it on with that old coot?
That was the night we stopped being a myth and started becoming real.
They say that the women in New York are the most beautiful women in the world.
Which explains why men in New York spend all their time looking at them.
The city is a veritable playground for men's roving eyes.
"Unfortunately, they need both of them looking straight ahead to survive."
This New York woman was pretty happy.
"Unfortunately, my New York guy was still seeing other women."
"If checking out other women is the biggest problem you are having with him, you're lucky."
"If it's so small, he should be able to stop."
You can't change that about a man.
"It's part of their genetic code, like farting."
You're gonna put me off my pretzel.
You have to take Big the way he is.
"Once you try to change a man, it's doomed."
"I know, but you can subtly manipulate and cajole."
The only things you can work on are their hair and wardrobe.
"But even then, it's a constant battle."
I already like the hair and wardrobe.
"I'm not asking for perfection, I'm just looking for slight alterations."
"If you pull the wrong thread, everything falls apart."
While Samantha and I discussed the theory of change...
...Miranda was going through it for real.
"She had a new apartment, a new boyfriend..."
...and a new dating schedule that was killing her.
I thought we'd be closing the bar earlier.
We were gonna close the bar at
Then we got this big group of Japanese bankers came in.
And all they want is these big flaming drinks.
Then one of them got sick and....Never mind.
Everything was great about Steve except for one thing.
Steve had all the time in the world in the morning.
I have to go to work.
The only thing she liked inside her in the morning...
...was the cup of take out coffee she drank on the way to the subway.
"That night, in a bed across town..."
"...Charlotte was seeing a lot of Mike, a cute, but feared restaurant critic..."
...famous for his patented five whisk rating system.
You are a five whisk woman.
But just when Charlotte had become comfortable with the penis...
...she got a very unexpected surprise.
The only uncut version of anything Charlotte had ever seen...
...was the original Gone with the Wind.
"There was so much skin, it was like a Shar Pei"
You've never seen an uncircumcised one?
"Reminder: you're dating the guy, not the penis."
"It's not what it looks like, it's what they can do with it."
I don't need one that can make its own carrying case
"Personally, I love an uncircumcised dick."
"Hard on the outside, with a delicious surprise inside."
I like it all out there where I can see it.
"I'm sorry, it is not normal."
"Great, now they're taking over the world"
"...that means I've only slept with of the population, tops."
"You know, he's a nice, waspy guy."
Maybe his parents were hippies and didn't believe in it.
I am so circumcising my kids.
I think you can pay people to do that now.
I don't ever wanna know there's a woman out there calling my son a Shar Pei.
"All I'm saying is, uncut men are the best."
I've slept with five of them.
"That night, Big and I went out to celebrate absolutely nothing."
"Listen, my editor called me today and she's...."
Excuse me; you can't smoke that in here.
"You're absolutely, positively sure about that?"
Because I checked the zoning on this particular table...
...and I'm pretty sure this table is in a cigar friendly zone.
"I don't mind, but it's for the other patrons."
"You mean if those five patrons don't mind, it's okay with you?"
Excuse me; this is my last day on earth.
"Would you mind terribly if I smoked this, ladies?"
Would it be okay if I smoked this?
"Please, let me preface this by saying: I'd like to buy everybody a round of drinks."
"Apparently, the other patrons aren't bothered at all."
I didn't have the guts to tell Big that he was actually kind of bothering me.
They won't tell you the truth.
No one is gonna say to your face they hate your cigar.
I thought that's what you liked about me.
Maybe we were at that inevitable point in the relationship...
...when all those little things you loved about the other person become huge liabilities.
"And just then, a huge liability walked by."
And you told me right to my face.
New York City is all about change.
"New Yorkers change their haircuts, their politics, even their friends in the blink of an eye."
"If change was so easy, why was it so hard for Big?"
"Was I banging my head against the wall, thinking I can get him to stop and notice me?"
Did I have to change my expectations or was it possible...Can you change a man?
My husband used to be obsessed with watching sports hours a day.
Then I started fooling around with his best friend.
And now he's obsessed with watching me.
Every girlfriend I've had wants me to change something.
"Change your job, change your friends, change your attitude."
The only thing I ever change is girlfriends.
"Meanwhile, Charlotte was about to discover that some men can change."
Can I come upstairs with you?
"I have to get up really early, and my place is just a mess."
"Yeah, what happened the other night."
You're not the first woman to react to it that way.
I've gotten it most of my life.
"Yeah, and I've decided to do something about it."
"I've been uncomfortable for too long, so I'm getting circumcised."
It takes a long time to heal.
But I'm willing to do that.
I want to feel good about making love.
Some men could budge an inch.
"In Mike's case, it may have been more like an inch and a half."
"The next morning, Miranda was getting her usual wake up call."
"Come on, lay down, slow down."
How long are we gonna do this?
You want a time frame for cuddling?
It helps if I have an end point in mind.
"That's your problem, you got too many limits."
You gotta let go a little.
"Saturday is my free day, right?"
I have spinning and then I get my dry cleaning.
Then I get my nails done and I do my grocery shopping for the week.
You're not sounding very free to me.
Do you want to come with me and get my dry cleaning?
"An hour and a half, tops."
"Twelve hours later, Steve went to work."
"About the same time, we went out to our favorite bar..."
...which on Saturdays changes into drag queen bingo.
"I really like him, but this morning thing is killing me."
It s bad enough we've never done it at night.
"After we do it in the morning, he just wants to lie there with me."
Everyone wants a guy who wants to cuddle.
Big won't even spend the night at my place.
What you have is real intimacy.
"I've been horizontal all day, and I had errands to do."
You don't have to spin if you're having sex.
"I don't know why I play this, I never win."
Why do I have to be the one to change my routine?
Maybe because you really like the guy.
It wouldn't kill you to slow down a little.
Why is it the woman who always has to change and never the guy?
I haven't done morning sex since I was in college when I didn't have class till
Maybe you guys should come up with a schedule or something.
Surprise him at the bar wearing nothing but a trench coat and a smile.
That would be a happy hour.
I think that if you really believe in the relationship you should work at it.
This from a woman who dumped a guy over foreskin.
Please tell me that we're not invited to the Briss.
"Can I get another board, please?"
Brad was a semi professional hockey player...
...Samantha had dated a few years back.
Apparently the only thing he was checking these days were his pants at the door.
"About five years ago, right after you."
"Apparently, she could change a man."
"There are other people here who need boards, Samantha."
"Take a chill pill, Miss Saigon"
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
I am so much prettier than him.
"Two hours later, I was supposed to meet Big at his place."
"Two and a half hours later, he showed up."
Your doorman thinks I'm a hooker.
I hate waiting here for you.
There's a coffee shop around the corner you could have waited in.
"You know, if you gave me a key, I could wait upstairs next time."
Or you can stay at my place sometimes.
It's easy to pick my locks.
"Yeah, but then I like my bed."
Neither of us wanted to make love.
"If this was all I was ever gonna get out of Big, was it enough for me?"
"Then at a.m., somewhere between sleep and waking..."
You knocked me out of bed
You didn't even know I was here
Why don't you break my arm the next time?
"All right, Sugar Ray, the bed's all yours."
"Wait, would you just let me explain?"
"And at a.m., I decided he couldn't sleep either."
"Okay, I know I've lost a little of my power here."
I'm pretty sure that most women's magazines...
...would say that what I just did was a very bad idea.
"But the thing is, the other night wasn't just about the cigar."
I hate that you look at other women.
I hate that I don't have a key to your place.
You've never spent the night at my place.
You can't even make space for me in your bed.
And it's not your fault because I never say it.
So now I have to say it.
So now I'm gonna say it.
I feel like I'm back in your life and nothing has really changed.
"I know you can't change a man, and you definitely can't change a man like you."
But...I still want...something to change a little bit...for me.
Physical violence is never the answer.
"Look, I'm sure there are things you don't like about me."
I'm not falling for that one.
That was one thing I liked about Big.
He definitely knew when to shut up.
"The next night, Charlotte took Mike out for a post operative scotch."
"On a scale of one to five, I'd give it a"
Now I just accept sympathy and heal.
"God, you really turn me on."
"Much later that night, bolstered by coffee..."
...Miranda decided to perform a a.m. seduction.
It's a.m. and I am still awake.
I've had five cups of coffee.
I think you should spend the night at your place tonight.
Because I'd really like to catch up on my sleep.
I really don't want to worry about having sex with you in the morning...
...and then just Iying there and being late.
You don't like having sex with me.
"But just once I would like to do it at night, like other normal Homo sapiens."
"Relax, we can have sex now."
"I had a window, and it happened half an hour ago"
You had a window for sex?
I'm a bartender and I get awfully tired of dealing with other people's neuroses.
"When you get, you know...a picture window, or a whole doorway of time...call me."
Miranda had never felt less like a successful lawyer in her life.
"Even though she'd won her case, she'd also been left with all the damages."
"A week later, Charlotte finally got her chance to break in the new merchandise."
It was like her birthday and Christmas rolled into one.
You realize this makes me a virgin.
So what do you want to do Saturday night?
"No, but I thought maybe we could go to this drama league benefit..."
"...or we could, you know, go low key and stay in and rent videos."
"I don't think I'm ready for this to be, you know, like a big thing."
I just feel like I can't be tied down right now.
There's a whole new me happening.
I should get out there and share it.
You want to share your penis?
I mean I feel like I owe it to myself to take the doggie out for a walk around the block...you know?
She realized you can take the Shar Pei out of the penis...
...but you could never take the dog out of the man.
"A few days later, I realized you could change a man."
You could change him into not calling you.
"Easy, no hands near the face."
I just came over to tell you something.
"Look, maybe you need a key to know that I'm crazy about you."
"But the thing is, I've given out, like, five keys..."
...and you never get em back.
And maybe I hog my bed.
But I mean it's my bed and I like you in it.
I should hit you more often.
This is something I don't like about you.
I hate that you eat oranges in my bed.
They're sticky and they make the sheets stink.
What are you gonna give me for the oranges?
It looks like I may have to spend the night.
"That night, for the first time, Big spent the night at my place."
I realized that neither of us would ever fundamentally change...
...but we were talking about it.
And maybe that was the biggest change of all.
The next day my sheets stunk of cigars.
"Across town, it was a.m. and Miranda was no closer to getting sleep."
"Look, I don't wanna bug you."
I just wanted you to see it.
"It was right then, that Miranda finally slowed down and gave into Steve."
"Come over when you're done, okay?"
"That night, Miranda and Steve made love."
And they did it again in the morning.
Miranda was an hour late for work and didn't even notice.
So maybe you can't change a man...
"...but once in a blue moon, you can change a woman."
"Here are some things I love about New York: That week in spring when it's warm, but not hot and the trees are just beginning to bloom."
"It's easy for me to say, I love you, New York."
"It's not so easy to say, I love you, Mr."
The first time I realized I actually loved Big was over toast and coffee one morning.
The first time I felt like saying it was the night he took me to the ballet.
I don't want to disappoint you.
A couple of those dancers were on wires.
On a couple of those big leaps I saw the wires.
I love your hair like that.
And then there was the time I never expected to say it.
Last Friday night at approximately p.
M Big was picking me up to take me out to dinner.
I just have to change my shoes.
"Hurry, we don't want to be late."
"If we grab a cab on Madison, we can be there in five minutes."
I just saw it and thought of you.
I didn't know what to say except: I love you.
"You told Big, I love you , because he gave you that?"
I think my mother has one in the shape of a squirrel.
"What did you think it was, a large diamond duck ring?"
"Note that I did not say, I love the purse."
He just sort of reacted stunned for a moment and then he said:
I'll just wait for you outside.
"Maybe he thought you said, I love it."
It was a very deliberate and distinct you.
He just pretended you didn't say it?
"Yeah, but we both know I did."
He has to say I love you back or I have to break up with him.
How long are you giving him?
I didn't put an expiration date on it.
"It's got the shelf life of a dairy product, it'll curdle in a week."
"Tell a man, I hate you , you'll have the best sex of your life."
"But tell him, I love you , you'll probably never see him again."
Did you ever think that at this very moment the man might be trying to find his way to tell Carrie that he loves her?
"It seemed that Miranda, love's greatest skeptic had recently experienced a romantic epiphany."
Grab us a seat outside and I'll meet you out there.
Will you let me pay this time?
She was dating a bartender who worshiped her.
Miranda was so crazy about him in return she let him take her out to dinner.
But only to places she knew he could afford.
"Best slices in the city, don't you think?"
"Saturday, my firm is having its annual dinner thing."
"I was wondering if you think the bar could spare you, you could be my date."
"I warn you, it'll be totally boring."
It's not gonna be boring if I'm there with you.
You probably should wear a suit.
It's gonna be a big fancy affair.
"You do have a suit, right?"
I don't have enough time to tell you what's wrong with corduroy.
"For the first time, Steve took Miranda back to his place."
I modeled it after DeNiro's place in Taxi Driver.
It's cheap and it's near the bar.
You never have to come here again.
That evening Miranda experienced her first pangs of yuppie guilt.
A lot of wonderful artists worked as bartenders for years.
It doesn't mean he won't make money some day.
"He's not an artist, slash, bartender."
"He's just happy being a bartender, period."
No aspirations beyond shaking cocktails and refilling peanut bowls.
Sounds like a dream relationship to me.
"He can make you cum, then make you a Cosmopolitan."
How can you get serious with a guy whose entire future is based on tips?
Rich men date not so rich women all the time.
"It's not about money, it's about compatibility."
It's normal for the guy to have more money.
I know lots of women who make more money than their husbands.
None of this matters to me.
I don't want it to matter to him.
"When single men have money, it's to their advantage."
"If a single woman has money, it's a problem to be dealt with."
"I want to enjoy my success, not apologize for it."
You're talking about more than a difference in income.
You're talking about a difference in background and education.
We don't say working class anymore.
You're trying to pretend we live in a classless society and we don't.
"Okay Marie Antoinette, we get the picture."
I'm dating a guy right now and he's got an actual servant.
It seems that Samantha was dating Harvey Terkel a real estate investor who had just made a killing in the market turning Chelsea sweatshops into luxury co ops for the upwardly trendy.
You won't eat better Thai food in Bangkok.
"You like spicy like Mr. Harvey, miss?"
I could not live without her.
"I wondered, was New York really any different from New Delhi?"
Had our class system been replaced by a caste system?
"And if so, can we date outside our caste?"
"That night, Big took me out for a romantic dinner."
I could smell it coming the way you can smell a thunderstorm right before it hits.
"A mere two days after I had said, I love you Big had found his own way to say I love you to me."
It's from a small winery in the heart of Tuscany.
I rented a villa there one summer with the ex.
I've always wanted to go back with someone I actually liked.
"There's something I've been meaning to tell you ever since the night I gave you the purse: You can take it back, if you don't like it."
That became the first night I wanted to tell Big I hate you .
"The next afternoon, Charlotte made the acquaintance of a member of the very highest caste."
"A caste that from coast to coast, rich and poor everyone deferred to and honored without question the movie star."
I'm the director of the gallery.
No no no That's a real fire extinguisher.
"For the gallery, in case there's a fire."
I guess I'm a total idiot.
"No, it happens all the time."
You can say you got it at the gallery.
People will probably think it's a Jeff Koons.
What do you think about closing up for the rest of the afternoon?
Can't wait to get you to bed.
This champagne is running through me.
"Yo, bud, pull over, I need to take a leak."
You'll never believe where I am.
I'm in the back of a limo about to go have sex with Wiley Ford.
"He's taking a leak out in the alley, isn't that cute?"
"Charlotte, listen to me, get out of there immediately."
All my rules just went right out the window.
"It's like, he wants me and I have to obey."
While Charlotte began to enjoy the perks of celebrity Samantha discovered Harvey Terkel came with some nice perks of his own.
Stay in bed as long as you want.
Do you like fresh orange or grapefruit?
While Samantha didn't believe in having servants she had no problem dating a man who did.
"She knew it might take some adjusting, but she could get used to it."
"Okay, lazy bones, out of bed."
Should I have my breakfast in the dining room Breakfast?
I got no time to make breakfast.
Got a lot of work to do around here.
It was then Samantha realized that Sum was not so servile after all.
"That afternoon during her lunch break, Miranda took Steve shopping."
I think it's frightening how good I look.
I think we should take it.
Could you do a cuff with a nice break?
I think we should take the shoes.
I guess we're taking the shoes.
I guess I better not spill anything.
"I invited you, I want to pay for the suit."
"No way, you're not buying me a suit."
I wanted to do this for you.
Then I start to think of you like my mother and that can get a little weird for me.
Would you like to try another one?
"Let's try on the card, I'll write a check for and the rest in cash."
Would you just let me buy the fucking suit?
"That Saturday, Big took me to a cocktail party at the home of Sarina Bush Great purse, fabulous."
an Upper East Side hostess famous for her husband's money and a close friendship with Tina Brown.
I knew her years ago when she was famous for her father's money and a close friendship with her drug dealer.
It's like being in a foreign country.
"Just think of me as your passport, baby."
"As we walked through the room of women clutching their bejeweled swan, kitten and asparagus purses I realized to my horror that not only did Big not love me he had absolutely no idea who I was."
Can I get you a drink?
Bush doesn't serve any brown food or drink.
Can I get you something clear?
I think we've encountered a mutant strain of Upper East Side anal.
"I've known her for years, she's okay."
I'm sure she's fabulous until you spill something.
It's like she's trying to cultivate an eccentricity so people won't notice she's completely devoid of personality.
You're being a bit of a bitch.
"Darling, you can't smoke in here."
"Just like that, I was cast out of the fancy party."
That same evening Charlotte found herself the newest member of Wiley Ford's entourage.
When did marijuana become legal in restaurants?
Sum was very rude to me the other morning.
She practically threw me out of bed.
Her English isn't really that good.
"It was then Samantha realized she wasn 't so dim, that Sum."
"That night, I realized that relationships had a caste system of their own."
"There's the person who says, I love you."
And there's the person who never responds.
"Jeremiah, What are you doing here?"
Just snuck out here to smoke.
Are you friends with these people?
A little uptight. What's with the no brown food deal?
"Jeremiah was a famous downtown performance artist who was best known uptown as: Kid, give me another scotch and soda."
We had engaged in a mild flirtation for years.
"I got a new tattoo, want to see it?"
How far down does that go?
Were you really giving the caterer a blow job?
"First of all, he's not a caterer."
He's a well known performance artist.
"Whatever you were doing, please stop."
If you'd joined me on the terrace like a gentleman we wouldn't be having this conversation.
"You go, I'm having a good time."
"And across town, Miranda was late for the firm dinner."
Why are you dressed like that?
Then why didn't you let me pay for it?
"Miranda, you need to be with a guy who's more on your level."
Being in that store with you I didn't feel good about myself.
I think you're an incredible lady.
You want to break up with me over a suit?
There's always gonna be things out of my reach.
I'm being punished for being successful.
That's not how I mean it.
Thanks for the info and for standing me up.
"An hour later, adrift in a sea of Italian wool crepe Miranda wondered what was really so wrong with corduroy, anyway."
"In the space of one evening, Charlotte had gone from girlfriend to groupie."
Who had the rum and coke?
I want you to do something for me.
I want you to go to the ladies' room stick your finger in your pussy come back and let me smell it.
"Charlotte realized, another moment at the top and she would have become an Untouchable."
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog Was a good friend of mine I never understood a single word he said But I helped him drink his wine After Jeremiah got fired, we celebrated downtown with a couple of pitchers of Margaritas."
Joy to the world All the boys and girls Joy to the Joy to the fishes in the deep blue I don't live here.
Joy to you and me That was the last thing I remembered that night.
If I were the king of the world
I'm gonna go grab a shower.
"I just tried to wash the sheets, but that lady hit me."
How dare you treat Sum that way.
Samantha realized there was only room for one woman in Harvey's life.
Listen I know what you're really pissed off about.
It's just something I gotta do in my own time.
It's just a tough thing for me to say because it always seems to get me in trouble when I say it.
I felt like I was the lowest of the low.
I figured everything before I love you just doesn't count.
There is nothing more humiliating for a woman than a visit to the gynecologist
unless it's having to tell your gynecologist you don 't need the pill anymore.
Are you trying to have a baby?
"I sort of jumped the gun going on it in the first place because Steve the guy that I went on it for, the first real relationship I've had in years, is over and I don't need a daily reminder that I'm not having sex."
So that's the story with the pill.
Just when Miranda thought she'd hit rock bottom she discovered a new geological layer of humiliation.
We got your tests back and everything looks fine.
It appears you have a lazy ovary.
Your right ovary has stopped producing eggs.
Is it possible it's just on strike?
My right ovary has given up hope that I will ever get married and have kids.
It's like a case you know will settle out of court.
It's ironic because that ovary went to Harvard.
The sperm have to jump over that hurdle to get to my egg.
"But once they get there, there will be an egg."
"I tried to go to a man, but it was too strange him spending all that time down there and leaving without an orgasm, and a bill."
I don't think these are accepted here.
I'm spending the night at Big's.
"My God After all this time, you don't have so much as a drawer there?"
That's why you have to just stake out some territory.
"Sweetie It's not a land run, it's a relationship."
"With Big, I think it's best to walk softly and carry a big purse."
"Yes, she shouldn't leave anything there to remain a creature of mystery."
I never leave underwear because I never see it again.
Isn't it a little expensive disposing of lingerie every time you sleep with a guy?
That's why I stopped wearing underwear on dates.
That's why I'm never borrowing a dress from you again.
I once found another woman's underwear in a man's bed.
"Once in Steve's bathroom, I found one of those hair scrunchies from the '."
I'm not sure what was more disturbing: The fact that he had a girlfriend before or the fact that he dated someone who wore a scrunchie.
Half my music collection was left behind by past boyfriends.
I always give that stuff back.
I consider it a parting gift.
"Okay, then I want a T shirt that says: I dated a bartender and all I got was this lousy ovary."
"The next morning at Big's, I started to think."
If the things we leave behind become the archeological relics of our sexual history I should be able to leave something.
Ancient man left cave drawings to prove they existed.
And I didn't stop at that.
Man may have discovered fire but women discovered how to play with it.
Charlotte was making history as well.
"Tired of the Neanderthals she'd been dating she spent her night with a gay friend who catered parties for the gallery: Dessert chef, Stephan Bodean."
I had no idea that Betty Buckley was so talented
Maybe because she was in Cats.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
Thank you for accepting my last minute invite.
My friend Don canceled and we had had tickets forever.
It's refreshing to go out with a man I can talk to.
You want to grab a cappuccino?
"No, I've just got to get on home."
Or you could get one yourself.
It helps to show a little leg.
"You know, I tried that and nothing."
Is he gay or is he straight?
"The real question is: Is he a straight gay man, or is he a gay straight man?"
"The gay straight man was a new strain of heterosexual male spawned in Manhattan as the result of overexposure to fashion exotic cuisine, musical theater and antique furniture."
"Hopefully, he's a gay straight man meaning he's straight with great gay qualities."
Whereas a straight gay guy is just a gay guy who plays sports and won't fuck you.
He must be a gay straight man because he asked Charlotte out for a second date.
Unless he's a straight gay man in denial.
But Saturday night wasn't even a date.
I didn't wash my hair and I wore my glasses
"Are those recreational, because this drink isn't doing it for me."
I'm trying to jump start my ovary.
My mother's taking those for menopause.
"Does she have a tilted uterus, too?"
Isn't anybody going to notice my purse?
"No, but it is quite small and panty free."
You left your underwear at Big's.
"No, but I did leave a hair brush, a hair dryer, razors tampons and eye makeup remover."
"For the first time at Big's, I did a number two."
I think it's a good sign that I feel comfortable enough with Big to do a number two.
It is not a good sign
I went through a relationship never doing that at the guy's place including a weekend in Bermuda where I spent the whole time running to the lobby.
That's why I only date rich men.
Money means that there's enough space to distance yourself from the number two.
I have never done a number two at a boyfriend's place.
"Honey, you're so uptight, you need to do a number seven."
"Excuse me, it's from that guy at the end of the bar."
Dominic Delmonico was a publishing magnate and the first and only man Samantha really loved.
"He wined and dined her, set the bar for hot sex then dumped her for an Icelandic supermodel named Anka."
"Once, on the cover of Fortune, he'd fallen to tabloid level due to a messy public divorce."
After what he did to you?
Imagining Samantha with a broken heart was more confusing to Charlotte than a French kiss from a gay man.
I'm the one with the power now.
Just a few things you left at my place.
It's like I had one too many items and I was being kicked out of the relationship express lane.
What is it about Big's apartment?
I meant to leave that stuff at your apartment.
"For one thing, I don't wake up looking like this."
I actually need stuff to look like this and it would be nice not to have to carry it around all day with me like a nomad.
And you can leave stuff here.
I don't want to leave stuff here.
"Just like, you know, if you want to shave in the morning."
You want me to leave socks here?
Why don't you just tell me what I want?
"No, really, in your mind what is the ideal living situation for two people in a relationship?"
"I have my place, you have yours."
"We're together when we want to be, we're apart when we want to be."
Ever since Woody Allen described waving to Mia Farrow across the Park single men in Manhattan had yearned for that kind of separate togetherness.
I felt like the last dinosaur.
Was I the one who needed to adapt?
Was my view of a relationship extinct?
I couldn 't stop thinking about it.
"This is a city where gay men are so out, they're in where women are so chronically single, ovaries may be the next vestigial organ."
We can have anything delivered anytime.
"We can have our dogs walked, our clothes cleaned, our food cooked."
Who needs a husband when you have a doorman?
Are New Yorkers evolving past relationships?
"Relationships have declined since women left the cave Iooked around and said, This isn't hard."
"So you don't need a man, but do you still want one?"
I can't decide whether you represent our future or our demise.
Seeing Dominic reminded me of how needy I was and how far I've come.
It took you a year to get over him.
Why do you go out with him again?
Because he treated me like shit.
I'm gonna make him want me and right before we do it I'm gonna drop him like he dropped me.
As long as you've got a plan.
"Not only a plan, I have a dress."
"Samantha's revenge fantasy, like all her fantasies, was even better live."
So successful and I'm getting gray hair and Anka is taking me for everything I've got.
I read that she got the sailboat.
We had good times in that boat.
Have I mentioned how unbelievable you look in that dress?
Since Stephan hadn't come out Charlotte accepted his invitation to stay in.
Grilled Portobello pizzas topped with fresh basil and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.
"Look, you have the silk placemats I've been eyeing at Bergdorf's."
Charlotte wanted to be open minded but Stephan seemed to be making it as hard as possible.
"Meanwhile, Samantha was making Dominic as hard as possible."
This was the moment Samantha had waited years and years for.
"My relationship is at a standstill, so instead, I'm evolving my look."
How did it go with Dominic?
That wasn't part of the plan.
I wanted to remind him what he was missing.
I can't believe I thought he was such a great lover.
In order to survive two decades of dating in New York Samantha had become a powerful hybrid: The ego of a man trapped in the body of a woman.
Charlotte feared the opposite was true of Stephan.
"She still needed help classifying her find, so she brought in a team of experts."
"In that photo, your hair is free flowing and Botticelli esque."
"Cannolis and cream puffs and tarts, oh my"
I put a little bit of everything.
It's a date tart with pumpkin custard.
"My nutritionist will kill me, but somebody hand me a fork."
I have got to glaze my wedding cake.
Get back to me on the tart.
"Which, of course, means he's straight."
He's obviously choosing to be straight because he seems to be head over heels about her.
What if he's gay and he doesn't know it yet?
"When I was a boy, my father gave me a book about the female body to teach me about sex."
"I took one look at it and said, No."
I haven't slept with him yet.
"All the good ones are straight, even the gay ones."
Are you looking at my forehead?
"That night, Miranda went out with Joseph Adler a labor relations lawyer who'd been after her since the firm retreat."
You can look if you want.
It's actually starting to fill in.
"She'd refused him twice before, but since she was down to her last ovary Miranda decided she was in no position to eliminate men on the basis of hair plugs."
"I'm telling you, I was practically bald."
"Actually, I was thinking you seem very happy."
"The funny thing is, I never thought that I'd be the kind of guy to get plugs."
But I've learned that you should never say never.
There are things that I've considered lately that I never thought I would consider.
Do you really want to know?
I recently found out that I have a lazy ovary.
It just means that I only produce an egg every other month.
"I'm not even sure that I want kids, but all of a sudden it hit me that if the other ovary shuts down, I'm out of business."
I've started taking hormones and now I'm actually considering freezing my eggs.
I think it would take the pressure off.
It removes the whole biological clock issue.
"Yeah, but it raises a lot of other issues."
"Such as, what is all this reproductive technology doing for us?"
Do we want desperate women having babies at
Maybe some people aren't supposed to procreate.
Maybe this is the world's way of weeding out the weak.
"If you ask me, this is a ridiculous abuse of science."
You have now designer sperm and these simulated wombs.
Why don't we just eliminate men altogether?
I don't need to be lectured about science by a man who's doing crop rotation on his forehead.
"Not because of what Joseph said, but because she was only she still had her left ovary and she wasn 't ready to settle out of court."
Maybe someday there would be eggs in her freezer.
Meanwhile Charlotte decided to stop trying to figure out her creature of mystery and just enjoy.
I have to ask you something.
Have you ever been with a man?
Have you ever been with a woman?
"I'm sorry, it's just Betty Buckley and Martha Stewart and Cynthia Rowley"
I'm a year old pastry chef who lives in Chelsea.
"If I were gay, I would be gay."
You're the one who doesn't want to make love.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
"Charlotte was relieved and delighted to discover Stephan was definitely straight, or at least a gay straight man."
"Frankly, after two orgasms, who the hell cares?"
"The next morning, it dawned on Samantha that her desire for revenge was not as strong as her desire for Dominic."
Anka and I are giving it another shot.
You can't do this to me.
I'm supposed to do this to you
Stop beating me to the punch
As she watched history repeat itself Samantha realized she couldn 't do what Dominic did because she hadn 't evolved past having feelings.
"In a way, that was nice to know."
It's warm cranberry buttermilk scones and lemon curd.
"If I continue dating you, I'm gonna gain pounds."
It's kind of like a squeaking.
At that moment Charlotte realized her masculine side wasn 't evolved enough for a man whose feminine side was as highly evolved as Stephan 's.
I spent the night at Big's for the first time since my stuff was kicked out of the nest.
It's where my hair dryer is.
I may have to dry my hair.
"I'm wearing it straight, in case you didn't notice."
But I think it looks pretty amazing right now.
Bring that gorgeous ass back into bed.
I just have to make sure I didn't leave anything else.
"Suddenly, I realized I didn't have to worry about leaving something behind because I was there."
But I'm leaving this underwear here.
"Okay it was a small step for mankind, but it was a really big step for Big."
New York City restaurants are always looking for the next new angle to grab that elusive and somewhat jaded Manhattan palate.
"Last year, it was Fusion Cajun."
"Last month, it was Mussels from Brussels."
Samantha's PR firm was hired to do the opening party for La Douleur Exquise.
"Of course, we were all invited."
This is what happens when the Mayor shuts down the sex shops.
I know where I'm taking Mother for dinner the next time she's in town.
"Excuse me, but when did wild sex come back in style?"
I think it was the weekend you spent at the Barneys warehouse sale.
"Three Cosmopolitans, a Diet Coke, and a vodka Martini with a twist."
What do you tip for that?
How does he wait on tables dressed like that?
"The summer I worked at Howard Johnsons, I wore an orange hat."
This is just a sexual expression.
All these people have jobs and pay their bills.
They're just having fun with fetishes.
I wonder what your fetish is?
Charlotte has a thing for Crabtree and Evelyn potpourri.
The difference between us and them is: They're putting it out there where everyone can see.
I think it's healthy and fabulous.
It was lovely to see you all.
And remember ladies: Whipping on the first date is considered forward.
"Sit your ass down, Mistress Carrie."
Big's flying to Paris tomorrow for business and I wanna say goodbye.
Why not give him a goodbye he'll never forget?
"I wasn't sure if it was the cap, the crop, or me, but it worked."
"Meanwhile, at a fetish across town, Stanford Blanche had a secret sex life."
A very active secret sex life on the Internet as Ricklus.
It all started innocently enough as a goof on a lonely Friday night.
But pretty soon he was logging in hours and hours on his favorite website.
It was a comfort to know that others shared his underwear fetish.
Sometimes as many as hits a day.
"No sooner had Ricklus entered the chat room that he got a message from his favorite on screen pal, Bigtool."
Some fetishes can only flourish behind closed doors in the very late night hours on a laptop.
While others are out in the broad daylight where everyone can see them.
"Charlotte, like every other normal woman in Manhattan, had a thing for shoes."
Would you like to try them on?
I have way too many shoes as it is.
I'm saving for a summershare in the Hamptons.
Please take it off before I start to cry.
Shoes were meant to be loved.
You're gonna need a beautiful sandal like that in the Hamptons.
While one woman was uptown eyeing her artful new sandal another was downtown eyeing Art of Scandal: The Life and Times of Isabella Stewart Gardner.
Miranda was obsessed with reading historical biographies.
In fact she spent all last weekend in bed with Philip of Spain.
Crazy Horse and Custer: The Parallel Lives of Two American Warriors.
I just finished his Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson: Undaunted Courage.
I'll pick that up right after I finish F.
And right after Miranda picked up Elizabeth I by Jasper Riley Jack picked up Miranda.
Big and I stayed in bed all morning which gave us just enough time for coffee and some last minute details.
I'll be back in a week and you can sit there and watch as I unpack.
"Before I forget, Charlotte wants to do a share in the Hamptons."
Are we thinking about it or should I go in on that?
"Why, not a big fan of the crab salad?"
There's a possibility I'm not gonna be here this summer.
I may have to move to Paris for work.
It's been in the works for a while.
I'll know more details after this trip.
When did you plan on telling me?
"I have to go, or I'll miss the plane."
We'll figure this all out when I get back.
He's standing there giving me the what's the big problem eyes.
"I don't understand, like it's my problem."
There are ways to make this work.
You can go visit in Paris.
It's about the fact that I wasn't even a factor in his decision making process.
Men do this all the time.
And their version of we is me and my dick.
Just tell me what's going on
Is that too much to ask?
"Carrie, I'm thinking about going to France for the rest of my life"
"One minute he's all over me, and the next he's pushing me away."
"And I just cannot believe this is happening, again"
There'll be no breaking of things.
Why do I keep doing this to myself?
I must be a masochist or something.
That's when I first realized it.
I was in an S M relationship with Mr.
"In love relationships, there is a fine line between pleasure and pain."
"In fact, it's a common belief that a relationship without pain is a relationship not worth having."
But how do we know when the growing pains stop and the pain pains take over?
"Are we masochists or optimists, if we continue to walk that fine line?"
When it comes to relationships how do you know when enough is enough?
When you read The Complete War Memoirs of Charles de Gaulle get back to me.
"On Tuesday night, Miranda and Jack had dinner."
In the biography of her life this would go down as the best first date in history.
This is kind of what I wanted to show you.
Right around the time he wrote Huck Finn.
I'm gonna show you his little house.
Just when Miranda thought she could read Jack perfectly he opened an entire new chapter.
"Someone might come by, we could get caught."
A chapter entitled: I like to have sex in places I can get caught.
With my one man out of town in Paris I found time to have drinks with my other man.
"But in order to get it, I have to confess something."
I'm asking you not to judge me.
Who am I to judge anyone?
I had bangs in the .
I have cybersex on the Internet.
And this would be the nonjudgment part?
I think it shows a great deal of restraint.
"So, I've been chatting with this guy and we have a really great time."
But now he wants to meet and I don't know if I should.
What do you know about him?
Where does he want to meet you?
At an after hours gay club in the Meatpacking District.
Tell me why you want to go.
I haven't had good sex since before Cats was on Broadway.
He said he's really great looking and has a really ripped body.
After Ricklus went home I decided I was just drunk enough to call Big.
I would like to know how you could even think of going to Paris and not even think about discussing it with me.
I think about you all the time.
When were you planning to tell me?
"Okay, because I think about you all the time."
I think about us all the time.
Can we get into this another time?
It's never a good time for you.
"You're always sleeping, or you're going You're always going, Taxi"
Then you're on a plane to France for maybe a year.
You should be thinking about somebody else.
"Even if you don't know it, it is."
This is about basic human decency.
It's about being a grown up.
"You better get used to it because if you move, this is how our relationship will be."
You'll be sleeping when I'm eating and I'll be sleeping when Shit.
I have an important meeting at
"Don't call me when I'm sleeping because I have a job here too, you know."
"Even through my Cosmopolitan haze, I knew I had gone too far."
I want to give you head.
"A few days later on the way home, Charlotte couldn't help but notice a gorgeous pair of Italian slingbacks in the window."
I just came in to look.
You have a very high arch.
I was in Miss Debbie's Twirlers when I was a little girl.
Why would you do something like that?
Because these beautiful feet are tired and they need a little rub.
"When a shoe fetish meets a foot fetish, all reason goes out the shop window."
I am way overreacting to this whole France situation.
"I think Charlotte's right, there are ways to work this out."
What made you change your mind?
I completely lost my shit to Big on the phone.
And I realized how close this whole thing is to really blowing up.
"Yes, it's painful sometimes, but it's worth it, you know?"
The guy has to go there for work.
And what is so awful about spending a week here and there with your boyfriend in Paris?
"Great, your love life takes you to Paris and I'm fucking in the back of a cab."
We've done it in the bathroom at Bond Street.
The elevator at the Marriott Marquis and a public restroom in Central Park.
How very George Michael of you.
"We've actually never done it lying down, or inside, for that matter."
"This is supposed to be a relationship, not Outward Bound."
You've got to get him in a bedroom and find out what's really there.
I'm a little afraid to try.
He likes the threat of getting caught.
What if being with just me isn't enough?
"Excuse me, Miss Charlotte, what is happening south of your ankles?"
The guy just kind of gave me a deal.
He just wanted me to have them.
He just really loves it when people love shoes.
"Sweetie, this is New York City, nobody loves anything that much."
"Well, I let him hold my feet."
"The second she said it out loud, she knew what she had to do."
I can't keep these shoes you gave me.
"You've already worn them, I can't take them back."
Then I'll throw them in the garbage.
"I'd buy them, but I can't afford it."
Six new styles just came in.
I've never seen them on a foot.
Charlotte looked down at the exquisite shoes.
The smell of leather was intoxicating.
All I have to do is try the shoes on?
"Cinderella in a dirty, kinky, freaked out, storybook, parallel universe."
I was at his door by to welcome him home in style.
"Bonjour, voila le French hat, Voila, le French fry."
"I have le Big Mac, and le Filet de Fish."
It's an apology for being le bitch.
"If things get really bad, then I'll move to Paris for a while and write Le Sex in le City."
"But you'd be moving to Paris for yourself, right?"
"I mean, don't move for me."
Why would I move to Paris if it wasn't for you?
I'm just saying I don't want you to uproot your life and expect anything.
"I'm running around town in a beret, buying your greasy food and you don't even care if I'm in your life"
I'm so tired of calming down
"Look, I have to be in a relationship where if I have to go to Paris, I have to go to Paris."
Then what happens to us next year when you decide you just have to go to Brazil?
This is about us getting closer and you getting so freaked out that you have to put an ocean between us.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Why is it so hard for you to factor me into your life in any real way?
I guess old habits die hard.
Maybe I can't do this anymore.
Then why does it hurt so fucking much?
On the way home I was furious.
"He might be the one with the whip, but I was the one who tied myself up."
Tied myself to a man who was terrified of being tied down.
"And downtown, in the Meatpacking District another terrified man was preparing to face his fears."
He hadn 't been seen in his underwear by a roomful of men since seventh grade gym class.
It would have been rude to stand up Bigtool.
"To her surprise, Miranda had no trouble getting Jack to agree to make love in his bedroom that night."
"Suddenly, her fear of his fetish ended."
Miranda realized that Jack's excitement wasn't about getting caught.
It was about her and she really began to let loose.
Something she'd been unable to do outside.
They sound like they're coming in here.
"At first, Stanford thought he'd be shunned for lack of the popular six pack abs."
Stanford Blanche had never felt more special.
Stanford learned that sometimes a brief encounter can be quite fulfilling.
I was still wide awake at
"After we made love, I knew it was over."
Did I ever really love Big or was I addicted to the pain?
The exquisite pain of wanting someone so unattainable.
What are you doing over there?
Let's not pretend we're something we're not.
"I wanted to go to him, but I felt like I was tied to the chair."
"Some part of me was holding me back, knowing I had gone too far."
"And just like that, I had untied myself from Mr."
But there was nothing exquisite about it.
In a town where everyone's dying to couple up sometimes there's nothing better than being out of a relationship.
You have time to do your laundry freedom to play your favorite bad music really loudly.
But the best part of being out of a relationship: Plenty of time to catch up with your friends.
"I really do, because if you think about it I was the best thing that ever happened to him."
Because I get to walk away and be me and he has to walk away and stay him.
Who wants to be him when you can be me?
I was totally the poof in the relationship.
I've got more poof than he could ever have.
"Sometimes, I poof just hailing a cab."
"So, I guess it's better to know now so I can go poof someone else."
"Someone who deserves me and not some screwed up, insecure guy who can't deal with a woman who's got her act together."
"Now, I'm gonna end up deliriously happy and Big is gonna die old and alone and I pity him."
"You're obsessed with talking about Big and frankly, we can't take it anymore."
"Yes, stop her before she obsesses again."
Isn't part of the breaking up process that you get free rein to whine to your friends?
But maybe you should think about whining to a shrink.
Why should I pay someone when we can talk for free and then get a drink or whatever?
"Then we're cutting you off, cold turkey."
"Look, we're as fucked up as you are."
It's like the blind leading the blind.
Sometimes it helps to talk to somebody who's objective.
"Okay, I understand why you see a shrink because you're always in your head but I'm fine."
"Besides, I don't really To be honest, I just don't buy the whole shrink thing."
My parents believe that any head problem can be solved with physical exercise.
That's why all of us are really good tennis players.
"First you go once a week, then three times a week and next thing you know you start sentences, My shrink says"
My shrink says that's a very common fear
Therapy is just so self indulgent.
Ancient man didn't need shrinks to survive.
Had I crossed the line from pleasantly neurotic into annoyingly troubled?
I decided to seek my own professional help.
How can you not have a shrink?
"The fact was, Stanford was right."
The therapist was as ubiquitous in Manhattan as pirated cable.
I do: One when I want to be cuddled one when I want tough love and one for when I just want to look at a really beautiful man.
Which is why I see the other two.
"No, Miranda's shrink referred me to one."
Why does she go to a shrink?
She suffers from high self esteem.
"While I was contemplating the couch, Miranda was enjoying hers."
"Two nights later, she had another nocturnal rendezvous."
"Soon, Miranda found herself with a nightly playmate."
"A week later, I kept my date with Dr."
"So Carrie, tell me why you're here."
"Well, my friends can't handle me anymore."
You're like very expensive foster care.
They tell me that I talk about my ex boyfriend too much.
"But that's normal, right, after a break up?"
I don't like the term normal.
"No, of course you don't, because you wouldn't have any patients."
"So, tell me about him: The ex."
"You know, I have to be honest."
I'm not sure I really believe in therapy.
I'm more of a solve your own problems kind of gal.
"He was sexy, just totally screwed up."
"He was playing all these games, and I didn't know the rules."
I was just along for the ride.
Was this the first time you dated a man who couldn't give you what you wanted?
"Well, that's a little easy, don't you think?"
"Maybe I've dated men who were wrong for me, but who hasn't?"
The thing they have in common is you.
Maybe you are picking the wrong men.
"Well, of course you pick the wrong guys."
"Jesus, I could have told you that."
"Frankly, I think I picked the wrong therapist."
She just did not get me at all.
She thought I was a game player.
It's the only way to deal with men.
They're about mature and honest communication.
This from a woman who plays peek a boo with her neighbor.
"If you know what you're doing, you can control the situation."
The only place you can control a man is in bed.
"If we perpetually gave men blow jobs, we could run the world."
At least our hands would be free to greet dignitaries and stuff.
"I mean, even if you're in a relationship you still have to play games."
But maybe the game is not really over.
"That kind of delusional thinking is why you should be in therapy, too."
I do not pick the wrong guys.
"So what, you're like a fly strip for dysfunctional men?"
"Yeah, but one of those really pretty floral scented ones."
You can't swing a Fendi purse without knocking over five losers.
Where did all the great guys go?
There it was: Happy hour in the valley of lost men.
I've never seen this many of them rounded up in one space.
Sports night: Every female's fantasy a room full of captive heterosexual men all looking to be distracted during commercial breaks.
I'm getting a contact high from all the testosterone.
This is the happiest place on Earth.
If you ladies will excuse me.
"You're not a Knicks fan, I take it."
Don Seglar was a very successful importer of Mexican handbags.
He was fanatical about two things: Keeping the price of foreign labor down and the Knicks.
Maybe I can teach you a few things.
"We need to penetrate, drive to the basket."
Which is exactly what Samantha did two hours later.
"When I got home that night, I couldn't get Charlotte's words out of my head."
We spent our childhoods playing games.
Were they all just primers for the games we played as adults?
"Were relationships just a big chess match: Strategy moves, countermoves all designed to keep your opponent off balance until you win?"
Was there such a thing as an honest relationship?
Do you have to play games to make a relationship work?
I went out with this girl on Saturday night.
"I didn't call her again until Thursday, so I didn't seem eager."
I went out with this guy on Saturday night.
I thought we had a great time.
The asshole doesn't call me until Thursday.
I screened his call and didn't return it until Monday.
I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum.
Propose by Christmas or it's over.
My girlfriends said that was a game.
I think it was just smart.
"Besides, if he doesn't come through, I can always secretly get pregnant."
"The next day, I reluctantly showed up for my second appointment with Dr."
I was still a skeptic and I'd already read every New Yorker in the waiting room.
"When you think about it, what was I getting out of this anyway?"
"And then, at five minutes to my last scheduled hour I got my answer."
G: I had come a little early to catch up on my reading.
"I thought we could go on playing this coy game, or I could introduce myself."
Especially since I had worn my new dress for the occasion.
That New Yorker is from last year.
"Well, this New Yorker is a little behind on her reading."
"So, how long you been a Dr."
"Not very long, just three sessions."
I just had my one year anniversary.
"What'd she give you, a cake or something?"
"Listen, this is gonna sound a little weird."
Would you have dinner with me sometime?
"Maybe it was unethical making a date with Seth Robinson, photographer, in my shrink's waiting room but there was something about him."
And you met him at your shrink's?
It wasn't a setup or anything.
It's the crazy ones that have the good pills.
"Excuse me, but why is that on and who is Marcus?"
"Now that Ewing is injured, he needs to pull it out."
When did we start caring about basketball?
I don't get laid unless the Knicks win.
They and I have been on a very long losing streak.
The Knicks are the only ones getting screwed.
Why are you staying with him?
"Because the sex, what I can remember, was unbelievable."
"The next night, Miranda got a pleasant surprise."
Her date thought it was time they moved past peek a boo to playing doctor.
"Miranda wanted to play fair, so she gave him a little tit for tat."
"All over town, people were getting lucky."
Seth and I were having a great first date at the coffee shop.
She always has it in a different place.
Maybe it's some sort of Dr.
And it needs to be watered.
I've been going to her over a year.
I felt like I could talk to him about anything.
And in the spirit of psychological health and not playing games I decided to be honest.
"Later that week, Miranda went shopping for dinner."
Shopping quickly devolved into a game of hide and seek.
I thought I'd be an adult here and come over and introduce myself.
You're the girl who lives above the guy I've been cruising.
Miranda realized she was still playing with an imaginary friend just like she did when she was five.
"The next day, she called her shrink for an emergency session."
"Meanwhile, Sam had decided she would celebrate the end of the basketball season and the return of her sex life by watching the final Knicks game at Don 's."
"Now that basketball is over, I can give them my full attention."
They've been playing lousy ball this year.
The idea of lasting through another sexless season was more than Samantha could take.
"Meanwhile, I was getting plenty of action."
Seth and I had just come back from another amazing date.
"You have all the classics here: Clue, Parcheesi, and Twister."
I was the seventh grade Twister champion.
You're in a very compromising position.
I believe I'm in about compromising positions.
I am not gonna lose my concentration.
In no time it was yellow pants off.
So what do you think Dr.
G would have to say about this?
"I'm not really into therapy, I think it's kind of bullshit."
"So why are you in therapy, seriously?"
I'm really fucked up about women.
"After I sleep with them, I completely lose interest."
"I believe in therapy, this moment is called the breakthrough."
"Although she'd made some good points, I stopped seeing Dr."
I couldn't risk the humiliation of running into Seth in the waiting room.
I ran into my friend Skipper on the street the other day.
He'd just broken up with another girl.
I thought everything was going fine.
That's when they tiptoe up and clobber you.
What did she say she thought was wrong?
"Skipper, you're a very sweet guy."
This isn't about anything you did.
It's just that we're in very different places right now.
We want different things from life.
I need to spend more time alone.
"So, actually, we want the same thing."
We both want to spend more time with you.
"Three months before that, it was a dental hygienist named Tiffany."
"The timing is wrong, that's all."
You're one of the nicest guys I've ever known.
I feel like I've reached a time in my life when I need to focus on my career.
I don't want to feel guilty about that.
I don't want you to give up your career.
You really deserve someone who will appreciate you.
I don't feel like I have anything to give at the moment.
"And last year, it was Miranda."
I feel like I need to spend more time alone.
I've just reached a point in my life where I need to focus on my career.
I don't think that I have anything to give at the moment.
"Skipper, what else can I say?"
I have such horrible luck with women.
"I should've seen this coming, but I didn't because they wait for you to get relaxed and get comfortable before they bring the ice pick down between your eyes."
Not all women just the types of women you seem to be attracted to.
Over and over and over again.
Those ladies don't know what they're missing and missing and missing.
Skipper's pattern was clear to both of us.
He was a sweet guy who was perpetually attracted to women who were looking for jerks.
"Later that night, on a date across town Miranda was repeating a pattern of her own."
She had been dating a lawyer she met when they fought in court.
"A frequent guest on MSBNC, Kevin was not just argumentative he was an anger professional."
I think I gotta revise my opinion that only an idiot would want to go out to a movie these days.
It was worth the plus in snacks and water just to hear that bus driver behind us explain filmmaking to his wife.
"On the bright side, it was an interesting movie, right?"
It was a real Citizen Kane.
The actor who played Carlo was charming.
He looked like he walked into work before the anesthesia wore off from his lobotomy.
"All right, I'll just get us a cab, okay?"
You gotta face uptown to get a cab around here.
I've caught plenty of cabs this way.
In never never land where people confuse a lack of talent with charm.
"Come on, Gene Shalit, get in the damn cab."
Miranda hated how he ordered her around and told her what do every place except one.
Put your hands up over your head.
The weird thing is when he tells me what to do in life it drives me crazy.
But when he does it during sex it really drives me crazy.
That looks like a good spot.
"That what I hate in life, I love in sex?"
"So, how about if you limit your contact with him to just sex?"
I'm not ready yet to throw in the towel.
You're just ready to wrap it around his neck.
He's going through a very stressful time waiting to make partner at his firm.
"When that finally works out, I think he'll lighten up."
Or maybe you should face the fact that you're attracted to angry men.
"Wait a second, hold the eggs"
"In math, randomness is considered a pattern."
And I'm what they call a prime number.
She's got a very obvious pattern.
You wait for a perfect guy to ask you on a perfect date
"And when he does, you project this huge fantasy on him setting up these enormous expectations"
Which promptly blow up in your pretty face.
You put all your deviled eggs in one basket.
"Well, spread it around a little more."
Date a few guys at once and then you won't feel so disappointed.
Are you asking Charlotte to juggle?
None of us can afford to fall into this one man at a time pattern.
Look at how much time you wasted with Big.
"Next time I meet a handsome, rich, emotionally unavailable year old man I'll know what to expect."
Or will you make the same mistake all over again?
I wondered were we all just victims of conditioned responses?
Doomed to repeat the same unconscious relationship patterns?
"Were we all, in fact, just dating the same person over and over again?"
I guess I have dated quite a few artists.
But I don't think they were all the same person.
They were all narcissists with commitment phobias and substance abuse issues.
"But, in my opinion, the painters were very different from the sculptors."
Handsome waspy assholes who treat me like shit.
I only date girls with Sony Playstations or breasts.
"That night, Samantha became acquainted with the new neighbors next door."
Though she had never met them she already knew them intimately.
The idea that someone else was having great sex and flaunting it was more than she could bear.
"So she decided, if you can 't join 'em beat it."
It all fit Samantha's pattern to a T having a wall between her and the person she was having sex with.
After a few weeks of not seeing Big I was beginning to fall into some familiar patterns of my own.
Staying out till and sleeping till noon.
Ordering takeout from the same greasy Chinese and calling old friends who would always be there for me when I felt restless.
"Listen, I thought if you weren't doing anything you might want to meet for a drink after work."
"Wow, it's great to see you."
I was just gonna open a bottle of red.
I just gotta be somewhere by
"That's okay, I've got dinner plans at"
John was as dependable a pal as a gal could ever hope for.
"Fun, comfortable and easy to be with."
The kind of guy who you could shed all inhibitions and really be yourself around.
The one that moved to Phoenix?
So how's he doing down there?
"He's doing great, thanks for asking."
"I didn't have a relationship pattern, I had a between relationship pattern."
"I always went back to John after every devastating soul shattering, gut wrenching break up."
A real shot in the arm for my sexual self esteem.
Sure put a cherry on my sundae.
Why had I been keeping him on the bench all these years?
Did I really believe a relationship had to be difficult in order to work?
Do you want to have dinner Friday night?
"I should check my schedule, but I think I can make it."
"And just like that, I broke my pattern."
"Carrie, you can't date your fuck buddy."
The lady in the last row didn't hear you.
You wanna take the only person in your life that's there purely for sex and make him a human being?
What is a fuck buddy ?
"A fuck buddy is a guy you dated once or twice and it didn't go anywhere but the sex is so great, you sort of keep him on call."
"You mean you just call this guy up when you're, you know, horny?"
And he just comes right over?
"Well, he's not a slave, sweetheart."
But you don't have to know about it.
And you're guaranteed delivery within Manhattan in six hours or less.
And you guys all have one?
Mine moved to Chicago but now we have phone sex.
"A few moments later, emboldened by our conversation and high from too many tantric headstands Charlotte asked a man out for the first time."
I never sweated so much in my entire life.
Would you like to go out to dinner Friday night?
I wondered if Charlotte can break her pattern and ask out every man in Manhattan why couldn 't I have a deeper relationship with a man I have shallow sex with?
I wanted to tell him that he'd never actually seen me in clothes.
"Do you want a glass of wine first, or"
"When you said dinner, you meant dinner."
"It's just that, whenever we've had dinner, we've always, you know."
I'm just gonna get my purse.
"Like most first dates, we were off to an awkward start."
"The yellow tail sashimi, two pieces of salmon sushi and a spicy tuna hand roll."
"I'll have the chicken teriyaki, well done."
"No, the sushi's so amazing here."
I can't deal with the raw stuff.
"If I'm hungry, I'll grab a burger after."
"Hey, listen, before I forget this is for you."
"Forty minutes free long distance, continental U."
"It's to promote our new service: Seven days, seven hours, a day."
I get incentive minutes which I can distribute at my own discretion.
"So, if I'm lucky, I might get a whole hour next time?"
But if you're currently with MCI and switch then you get two free hours.
Maybe we should just order some sake?
We went back to my place for a quickie.
I needed to erase the stagnant memory of the past two hours.
Was it really possible that someone so stimulating in bed could be so tedious in life?
"Meanwhile, Samantha was actually beginning to look forward to the company of her new neighbors."
"Every night, like clockwork, right after the end of the news Samantha relished her role as the invisible guest vocalist to an unseen band."
"Until one night, she wasn 't so invisible."
"That Saturday, Miranda planned for us all to meet her latest fling for brunch."
"Apparently, he had flung himself elsewhere."
He should be here any minute.
It's not like we've got anywhere else to go.
"Once I broke the ice with him, it was just like riding a bike."
"I have so many dates this week, that I just scheduled two tonight."
One guy is leaving town and I couldn't cancel the other.
How do you conceive pulling this one off?
"Early dinner with bachelor one, late supper with bachelor two."
"My God, you're turning into a man."
Charlotte had done more than break a pattern.
I just don't know how I'm ever gonna eat two dinners in a row.
"And then, just like that, she was a woman again."
The idiot who drove me here apparently passed his driving test in Bangladesh.
I'm just happy to get off that fuckin' rickshaw alive.
"Kevin, this is Carrie, and Samantha, and Charlotte."
"I have to go make a call, I'll be back."
In a tightly wound sort of way.
He's finding out on Tuesday whether he made partner.
I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he'll unwind some after that.
I just don't want him going off on the waitress.
"That evening, Charlotte set out to break her pattern."
A casual meal with Eric from yoga discovering a mutual love for long drives up Maine coasts and reruns of Nanny and the Professor.
"But it was very subtle, very sophisticated."
I don't think that kids today would understand it.
"When I have kids, I'm gonna be a total nazi with the remote."
How many kids do you want to have?
As Charlotte began to swim in visions of family summers in Kennebunkport she realized she was late for the second shift.
I've just been fighting this cold all week.
I had a really great time.
While Charlotte was off to her next engagement Samantha was imagining an engagement of her own.
"Hi, I was just wondering do you know who lives in that apartment?"
"Later that night, Charlotte was returning from a second dinner of steamed mussels and fries with bachelor number two, an art loving commodities broker."
I had a really great time.
"Eric, what are you doing here?"
I was just leaving you some chicken soup for your throat.
I'm the guy she had dinner with before you.
You get to take her upstairs.
"From that moment on, Charlotte developed a new pattern."
She made it a rule never to take advice from her friends again.
Very late that night Samantha decided to roll out the welcome mat for her new neighbors.
The musician and the dancer turned out to be a middle aged Eastern European couple.
He played in a polka band.
She was a dancer once upon a time.
Would you mind keeping it down?
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Samantha broke a pattern after all.
She decided to move her bed to the opposite wall.
"Later that week, Kevin experienced a dream come true."
He was made a full partner of the law firm where he worked.
He took Miranda out to celebrate.
I'm falling all over myself with glee.
I get to work hours a week for the same salary.
Can't we enjoy your success for one second?
You don't get how stressful my life is.
"You really do live in never never land, don't you?"
By the way if there's a difference between this champagne and the crap for it takes a more delicate palate than mine to detect it.
"Well, I like the champagne, and the bread is fabulous."
"Oh my God, look at those flowers."
"And by the way, never never call me again."
Miranda broke her pattern in a way that she had never expected.
The angry guy had turned her into a cock eyed optimist.
There couldn't have been a more perfect moment to see Skipper for the first time since she dumped him.
"Don't tell me what to do, okay?"
I just wanted to say hello.
You got a lot of nerve talking to me like nothing happened ever since you tossed me out like bad milk.
Now that I've got you out of my system.
Can't I just talk to you for a minute?
Could I buy you a beer or something?
Miranda had never seen him as angry as this before.
"Much to her horror, she was attracted."
They don 't break because you tell them to.
"And a few nights later, John and I went out for a movie."
"I refused to believe that a passionate sexual connection could not be translated into a meaningful friendship, at the very least."
Isn't this the most amazing block?
All these brownstones are over years old.
It's like being in the New York of Edith Wharton and Henry James.
"Sometimes, I can't believe how lucky I am to live right here."
Your tits look great in that thing.
"At that moment, I knew we only had two things in common."
"Listen, I'd invite you in, but"
I got to be up really early tomorrow.
I knew it was the last time we'd ever see each other.
"Just like that I was thrown right back into my old pattern: Greasy Chinese, sleeping till noon and feeling restless."
"For some, it's bathing suit season."
"For others, it's that your birth certificate can never be legally destroyed."
"For Miranda, it was family hour at her gym."
"Kiddy Jazzercise, Aerobics Room five minutes."
"On Sundays, her neighborhood became occupied territory under siege to children."
"They were everywhere: Movie theaters, restaurants, bookstores, hair salons Starbucks was basically a stroller parking lot."
Was it too much to hope for one small space to call her own?
"No, it's just that he really likes to push the button."
"Fine, I'm in kind of a rush."
"Simon, this pretty lady said that you could push the button."
I'm sure it's just a phase.
"Yeah, the guilty, overindulgent phase of a D l V O R C E."
"Simon, we're not being very nice to"
That sounds like a princess name.
Do you want to go to the toy store later?
I am in violation of every parenting book ever written.
Any chance I could persuade you to take another ride?
It only took him another floor and a half to ask Miranda for her phone number.
The whole thing might have been very romantic if Simon hadn 't peed in his pants.
"I don't wear vintage clothes, I hate flea markets, I don't collect antiques."
"Is it too much to ask that he not be, I don't know, used?"
"Before it goes any further, just make sure his parts are still under warranty."
It's like chewing somebody else's gum.
Divorced men do come with baggage.
But when they come with kids
Especially kids with bladder control issues.
Round up all the divorced men and keep them in a pound.
"That way, you get their whole history before you take one home."
"If a man is divorced, it doesn't mean he has a problem."
"He just separated from his wife, Leslie"
"What is that, marriage by Mother Goose?"
Definitely a candidate for the pound.
"I was going to ask you to meet him 'cause he's coming to visit, and now forget it."
We want to meet Wesley of Wesley and Leslie.
", does he work for Nestle?"
My brother's very important to me.
I won't have him subjected to scrutiny and ridicule.
I always have to be Ridicule.
Why can't you be Ridicule for once?
"As for me, rather than sort through the half off bin I was dating someone brand spanking new."
I met Vaughn Weisel at a P.E.N.
It's amazing how much better looking fiction writers have become.
I just gotta drop these books by my parent's place.
They want you to write something?
They want me to wear something.
"It's so great to be a writer these days, there's so little writing involved."
Don't be photographed in anything sleeveless.
No one who went sleeveless ever won a Pulitzer.
It's just a little tip from me to you.
"Come on in, this will only take a second."
Can you just drop them through the mail slot?
If I'm here and I don't say hello I'm looking at two months minimum hard family time.
"Mother, I swear, you are the only person who can kill a cactus."
Tell your sister to stop bringing me plants.
I have to talk them down from the ledge.
Those books you asked me to sign
"Duncan, get your ass in here."
You know what you should write about?
Did you know there are women who are actually having their vaginas re stitched to make them like new again?
"If you're wondering, Mom just finished a documentary on genital mutilation."
Which I still haven't gotten your notes on.
"I told you, I can't bring myself to look at that thing."
And I typed all his short stories for him when he was
Do you know who this is?
She writes that column we love.
What are you doing Thursday night?
I teach a seminar at Columbia on Cultural Zeitgeist.
I'd love to have you come speak.
Self Involved here didn't tell us he was dating an icon.
J.D.Salinger used to get me high.
And then she'd call me at a.m
Beautiful and she thinks I'm funny.
Put your tongue back in your head and the lox on the table.
"Come on, everybody, let's have something to eat."
"I mean, really, within the space of five minutes I had next week's column, an invitation to speak at an Ivy League university and access to the entire Zabar's fish counter."
Have you ever gone out with someone who had a kid?
"No, but I've never gone out with someone I met on an elevator either."
"That's a first for me, too."
"I met a woman on an escalator once, but it didn't last long."
It was over by the time we got to Ladies Lingerie.
I dated a man once who wore ladies' lingerie.
That was kind of the problem there.
"Fortunately, I mostly use the right side of my brain."
"It must be hard, having a social life as a single parent."
"It is, I got to buy protective helmets for all my dates."
"The truth is, I didn't really have a great social life before Simon either."
I'm just one of those weird male aberrations who prefers to be married.
I like knowing there's people waiting for me at home.
I guess that makes me sound pretty dull.
Miranda wondered how a vintage man might look on her modern couch.
Probably not the best time to ask you to dinner.
While Miranda was dealing with queasiness Charlotte was handling depression which she felt could be solved with a homemade muffin.
Just like Nana used to make.
"Charlie, the muffins are great, but I'd much prefer a nice dry martini."
But Nana always made muffins to cheer you up.
"Post Leslie, I need a cocktail."
And you call yourself a Wasp.
"I don't see why you two can't work it out, you had the most beautiful wedding."
We'll have an even lovelier divorce.
I can't believe you're willing to just throw it all away so easily.
When was your last long term relationship?
The afternoon had been like six hours of foreplay.
Some men seduce with dim lights and soft music.
Vaughn seduced with chocolate chip cookies and relatives.
It was inevitable this would happen.
I just didn't know it would happen so quickly.
"Get out now, before he stains all your sheets."
It could be he was just nervous.
He probably had something to drink.
We'd spent the day with his family.
The guy could not get his Cadillac into the garage.
"I'm sorry, I hate being right about this."
Samantha was the General Patton of sex.
She didn't send her troops into battle if she thought they would lose.
"That's swell, but it doesn't get the cream in the cupcake."
But the thing I like best about him is his family.
"I'm telling you, this family is like They got charisma."
"Like Tom Cruise, they're the Tom Cruise of families."
I'm sure the family is supposed to be the obstacle to a relationship not the attraction.
I fucked a guy once because his family had a pool.
"He was pretty much of a nerd, but I'd go over there and get all cocoa buttered up."
She was always serving me Kool Aid and chips.
"And honey, you should have seen my tan."
"In my mind, the complications of making a relationship work had just expanded exponentially."
"When you date someone, how many people become emotionally involved?"
"When you sleep with someone, are you screwing the family?"
While I was still on the fence about Vaughn I had no doubt about my feeling for his mother.
I was in love with her.
Then we were in Nicaragua with the Peace Corps.
I can barely make one happen.
Don't pull that self effacing shit with me.
I know what you've got going.
You are putting it out there.
If it wasn't for you we wouldn't know half the things we do about other people's sex lives.
"No, it's wonderful to be frank and honest about sex."
That's how I raised my kids.
Sex was always a part of the discussion.
"When they were years old, they knew the proper names for their body parts."
None of this pee pee and wee wee crap.
"And as a result, they can talk to me about anything."
"When Franny told me she was a lesbian I said, Great, just as long as you're not a Republican."
May I just say I like you very much.
Did you talk to Leslie today?
Do you want to know about that?
I'm giving her the house and she's giving me an ulcer.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
You'll finally meet my friend Carrie.
"We'll go out, have dinner, maybe go to a club Shit."
"This is my wonderful brother, Wesley."
Good looks run in the family.
Can I get you ladies a drink?
How are you enjoying New York?
Samantha says there's a great jazz bar that we should go to.
I just don't think I'm up for it tonight.
Talking and going to hear jazz.
I think I have your son's Slinky embedded in my back.
I like to brand my women.
"I'm going to use the bathroom, and then I really will go."
"I was peeing, and I didn't want him to see me."
I was afraid he'd see me and then he'd be drawing pictures for a child psychologist and nobody's happy.
I'll go with you to the emergency room.
"One thing about families if no one's sorry to see you go, then you're probably not coming back."
"The next morning, Charlotte was in for a rude awakening."
Where do you keep your coffee filters?
Just tell me if I'm warm.
Is your vagina in the New York City guidebooks?
"It should be, it's the hottest spot in town"
"She was in my kitchen, she was wearing your shirt, I snapped."
"Who asked you to butt your nose into my Samantha, wait"
I didn't know your mom was nominated for an Oscar.
I just love that she still has so many ambitions for herself.
I'm not really in the mood to talk about my mom.
I'm not really in the mood to talk at all.
What was the documentary short about anyway?
"I swear to God, if you hand me a muffin, I'm out of here."
"She has so many notches on her bedpost, it's almost whittled down to a toothpick."
"You had your little fling, now you can go back to Leslie and work it out."
You think you know Wesley and Leslie?
Let me tell you about Wesley and Leslie.
"Leslie's frigid and before last night, Wesley hadn't gotten laid in two years."
I was going out of my mind.
"But until I saw Samantha, I didn't realize what I really needed: Sex."
So it was a good thing.
It was a frigging great thing.
That Samantha You've really got a good friend there.
That was a terrible thing I said.
If you'll excuse me I have another tour group coming through my vagina in minutes.
You said what you came to say?
I wanted to give you this.
She realized this was Charlotte's way of saying Thank you for fucking my brother.
Miranda decided she had ceded enough territory to the invading troops.
He really loves to push the button.
You in bed with my book.
Let's just take this nice and slow.
You tell me if you're feeling too excited and we'll take a little break.
Because I think we both really want this to work.
I love that you get so turned on by me and I am very turned on by you.
Maybe we've just been in too much of a rush.
"No, I don't want to forget it."
I don't want to talk about it.
Why does everything have to be about sex
I am so sick of talking about sex.
I've been talking about it since I was
Duncan and I went down to the Neil Simon Theater and spent
To see a British movie star simulate a blowjob.
I wonder if that's what Neil had in mind.
Franny tells me that you two are going camping this weekend.
It's out there on the table.
Don't let him pull that moody shit on you.
"Since he got published, he's suddenly this tortured artist."
Why buy this shit if you can't remember the one thing that holds it all together?
Let's deal with what's really upsetting you.
"If everything's on the table, why don't we start with some scallion cream cheese?"
Jenna and I looked at each other like two foreigners without visas.
"You know what, I think I'd better go."
"Thank you for lunch, for everything."
His last girlfriend wasn't as discreet.
I don't want to get in the irony.
This has officially become too weird.
"Really, in a situation like this, you gotta laugh."
He won't even talk about it.
You want me to talk to him?
I can't discuss this with you.
You and I can discuss anything.
So your sex life isn't so great.
Seventy seven percent of all marriages are sexless.
"Other things are so much more important, like family."
Then I saw that the person I really had to break up with wasn't Vaughn.
I would still like us to be friends.
And what happens when you meet somebody else?
"I can tell you now, they won't have a mother like me."
You know that we have something.
What we have is very special.
The most important thing in life is your family.
"There are days you love them, and others you don't."
"But in the end, they're the people you always come home to."
Sometimes it's the family you're born into.
And sometimes it's the one you make for yourself.
My friend Charlotte was dating Dr. Bram Walker...
"No, I was just resting my eyes."
I fell asleep for one second.
I was up at I had three carpal tunnels.
He fell asleep when he was making love to me.
This has nothing to do with you.
Has a man ever fallen asleep making love to you?
"No, but I'm sure many of them wanted to."
I can't believe this happened to me
I must be really bad in bed.
You are not bad in bed.
I've got Constant Comment and do you want some Tummy Tamer?
"I have to say, I'm not surprised."
Ever seen her on a Stairmaster?
"Even if she was bad in bed, which she isn't, is it really that important?"
Who we are in bed is who we are in life.
I never met a man who was bad in bed who was good at life.
"Just for the record, in bed, you are...."
Don't make me state the obvious.
How can you be so sure?
No one ever took a nap while fucking me and I get affirmations all the time.
"Last week, Samantha had dinner with a gay couple she'd known for years."
"I have to admit, we have an ulterior motive."
We're wondering if you're seeing anyone special right now?
Do you have a hot guy for me?
We want to have sex with a woman.
I'm always curious what it would be like.
We've never done it and we thought it might be fun.
"If we were gonna do it with a woman, who would it be?"
"We decided of all the beautiful women we know, you are probably the best in bed."
"For a sex columnist, you have a limited view of sexuality."
"The new millennium won't be about sexual labels, it'll be about sexual expression."
It won't matter if you're sleeping with men or women.
It'll be about sleeping with individuals.
"Or in your case, twos or threes."
It won't matter if you're gay or straight.
Just if you're good or bad in bed.
That night I got to thinking about bed.
Are we secretly being graded every time we invite someone to join us in it?
Is making love really nothing more than a pop quiz?
"If sex is a test, how do we know if we're passing or failing?"
How do you know if you're good in bed?
"Later that week, I was walking home thinking about my own sexual report card when...."
I thought I was stung by a bee.
You can't smoke in the restaurant.
"I'm a smoker too, but watch where you throw those things?"
"No, it didn't leave a mark."
"As the pain subsided, my mind was free to notice..."
...how incredibly cute this guy was.
"You gotta admit, it's a clever way to meet the ladies."
You got a little comedy routine going there?
"At least let me buy you a cup of coffee, or some burn salve?"
But it might be after a cappuccino.
There's a place right around the corner.
Three Marlboros and two Marlboro Lights later I had learned...
"...Patrick was a composer, writing music for movies."
What type of movies do you compose for?
The I Screamed When I Knew What You Did Last Summer On Elm Street types.
As long as you're challenged by what you do.
Maybe one day you'll give me scar tissue again.
"As I walked away, I started to think:"
"How many cute, smart, single smokers are there left in the world?"
I decided to do something I almost never do...
...give a man my phone number.
This whole burn lawsuit I plan to initiate...
"...it might get a little crazy, so here is my phone number."
You will need that for your attorney...
...or if you want to have coffee again sometime.
It was such a cute approach.
Give him more hours and then send him off to the island of lost men.
"I don't wanna send him there, I like him."
Could you believe that someone actually had the nerve to call this Florentine Peach?
I can't believe you spent this much on sheets.
I'm trying to change my bed karma.
I figure if I can make my bed a place I really want to be...
...others will feel the same way.
"If you build it, he will come."
"The thing that gets me is, I'm not usually wrong about the phone number size up."
I don't put it out there unless I'm pretty sure it's coming back.
I'm either really loving or hating the color.
A guy doesn't call you for three days and you're ugly?
We can feel totally good about ourselves...
...and then it all goes out the window if the guy doesn't mirror it that way back to us.
This has a little weird thing here.
Does everything I bring into this bedroom have to have a flaw?
The next day I was in the Village looking for the perfect dress...
"...to go with my shoes, when...."
I could turn around and run away...
"...or I could smile, be brave and walk on over."
Saturday's the day you stand on the street and smoke in the Village?
We're kind of in the middle of something.
I was on my way to Perry Street.
You're obviously in the middle of a thing with your lover...
We were just waiting for a meeting to start.
I wanted to introduce you but it's supposed to be anonymous.
I really wasn't getting the gay vibe from you.
"It's just, he was so cute and...."
I've only been in the program months...
...and my sponsor said I really shouldn't get involved with someone for a year.
"Okay, maybe you'll call me in a month."
It doesn't bother you that I'm an alcoholic?
"Hell, I hope to be one someday."
But it might be after a cappuccino.
"What the fuck, it's only a couple of weeks."
Would you like to go on a date sometime?
I accepted his kind invitation because when you think about it...
...aren t we all in recovery from something?
"On our first date, Patrick and I went for coffee."
"If I open up a bag of Chips Ahoy, I gotta eat the whole thing."
I'm like that with Reese's Pieces.
Wouldn't the shoes be a little tough on digestion?
Then I gave him my very best lean in and kiss me goodnight move.
"Our next date, over dinner, he told me about working his steps."
"After dinner, I stood on my third step trying to work him."
"I knew he wanted me, because during my lean in and kiss me goodnight move..."
"...I'd accidentally, on purpose felt his pop up and say hello."
"By the third date, I wanted him even more than a fistful of Reese's Pieces."
"Then I thought, how many cute, smart, sexy, single, smoking alcoholics..."
...are there left in the world?
Do you want to come up?
"Yeah, But you see, the thing is, I've never had sex sober."
I've always been drunk or high.
I don't know if I'll be any good.
Let's take it one step at a time.
Do other people know about this?
After we have a cigarette...can we do it again?
"I'll have a Spanish omelet, hash browns, more coffee and orange juice."
Can I have some rice pudding for later?
Patrick and I...All last night and I'm just....
Just because I'm bad in bed doesn't mean everybody has to be.
You are not bad in bed.
Has a man ever fallen asleep making love to you?
"No, but I once fell asleep when a guy was doing me."
I'm mature enough to realize that while I may be good at some things like...
"...accessories, that I might need help in others like...."
Just don't drink any suspicious Kool Aid or put on new Nikes.
It's taught by a well respected woman psychologist.
It's called How To Please A Man.
I know how to please a man.
Just give away most of your power.
I have a trainer for the gym.
I can have a trainer for
Are you actually going to do this?
"Seating was limited, so I signed you guys up."
"If Bram ever falls asleep on me again, I will die."
"Pretty please, with sugar on it?"
"What the hell, I don't exactly have them hanging from the rafters."
How To Please A Man. I could teach the damn class.
"That night, while David and David got undressed..."
...and waited for her in the bedroom.
Samantha began to wonder if maybe she was about to go too far.
Was she actually capable of being this sexually free?
Or was she getting in over her head?
"She decided before there were any regrets, they should all talk about it a little more."
Just like Jean Harlow in Red Dust.
Samantha loved the Samantha mirrored through the eyes of the Davids.
Let's all put on our clothes and go out for gelati
"Suddenly, Samantha wasn't feeling so good about herself in bed."
I gotta go or I'm going to be late for the tantric workshop thing.
"Baby, you don't need a workshop."
We did it last night and all this morning.
"I could have sex with you morning, noon and night."
Mr. Compulsive wasn t in bed with me...
...he was in bed with a big bag of Chips Ahoy.
The intent of tantric...we say sacred sexuality...
...is to experience and merge with the Divine.
I think Patrick's addicted to me.
It's like he's replaced drinking with me.
I dated a guy who was in Over Eaters Anonymous.
"Every time we had a fight, he'd binge eat hot fudge sundaes."
"In other words, ladies, to drive your man crazy."
He wants to have sex all the time.
It's getting a little out of hand.
At least he wants to fuck you.
"One minute they were interested and then, suddenly they weren't."
What did I do to turn them off?
Not having a dick would be the thing that you did to turn them off.
Use it to bring any man to his knees.
Where was this bitch last night when I needed her?
Be quiet and you might learn something.
This lady is supposed to be a genius.
"If she's so good, why is she having this workshop in her apartment?"
"Tantric sex is not about talk, it's about action."
"So, without further delay...let me introduce my husband."
I will demonstrate the very effective...Lingham Massage.
I think I know why we're in an apartment.
"The receiver lies on his back...before the giver, naked."
Genitals clearly exposed for the massage.
"An hour and a half later, crippled by our inability to look away from a car crash..."
...we watched as the Dr. Shapiro illustrated tantric sex.
Massage the head of the Lingham...as if you are using an orange juicer.
There go my good feelings about breakfast.
Place your right hand...on the receiver's Root chakra.
The Root chakra is located between the anus and the genitals.
I think that I just got my bucks worth.
Gently rock your hand to awaken this chakra.
Perineum: Latin for not without an engagement ring.
Will the women who are laughing compose themselves?
Orgasm is not the goal of Lingham Massage...
...but can be a pleasant and very welcome side effect.
...your man will always be faithful.
Because once they go tantric...they don't go back.
"And just like that, Miranda got hit by Old Faithful."
"That night after we talked Miranda in from the ledge, I met Patrick for a movie."
I was telling my sponsor today how I felt about you...
...and suddenly I realized maybe I should just tell you.
"There it was, the little phrase every girl is dying to hear..."
...a week and a half into a relationship.
"We have been going out for, like, a minute."
I don't want to play games.
I'm just trying to own my feelings.
"Mr. Casey, you do not love me...you love you, not drinking, with me."
I'm so flattered...but I think maybe we should slow down a little here.
It means that things are going very fast and....
You have all these new feelings because you're not drinking
"No, don't give me that program bullshit."
This has nothing to do with drinking.
Maybe we should spend a little time apart.
Are you breaking up with me?
I'm not breaking up with you.
"We'll do something next week, okay?"
What am I going to do now?
You should go to a meeting.
"And then go home, and call me tomorrow."
"My God, what are you doing?"
Charlotte considered it the best bucks she'd ever spent.
"It cost Miranda a little more, but across town in her bed, things were good as well."
I loved you and you didn't love me.
You fucking made me date you...before the month and now I'm drunk.
My first impulse was to go down and rescue him...
"...but as I learned on our second date, that would be codependent."
"Still, I felt I had to do something."
"Here, put this on, you'll get a cold."
"Quiet, asshole, I'll call the cops"
You were the best fuck I ever had
"Three weeks later, I got a letter from Patrick..."
...saying he was back in the program and wanted to make amends.
I never saw him again but I always wondered two things:
Was he able to stay sober?
Am I really that good in bed?
"This is a story about a lovely couple, Rob and Elaine..."
...who rented a house one especially hot and sticky summer in the Hamptons.
"Elaine invited her best single friends, Cindy and Janet..."
"...while Rob invited his single friends, Ira and Matthew..."
...to share the good times and exorbitant rent.
"Until one day, this lovely couple had a terrible fight..."
...when Elaine went for a run and twisted her ankle...
...and came back early to find Rob canoodling with Janet.
And Cindy got tired of Matthew's idiotic jokes and incessant market chatter.
Ira tried to be there for Elaine and confessed his true feelings for her...
...which she tried to laugh off as a joke.
"By August, it got to the point where everything was so awkward..."
...that nobody wanted to come back.
And that's when Janet called her friend Charlotte.
It's a really cute three bedroom cottage.
They're giving us a fantastic deal for the month of August.
Because it's haunted with cheating boyfriends and sexual rejection.
Sharing a house with your girlfriends is fine in your ...
"...but I feel like in your , isn't it a bit pathetic, like being the oldest kid at summer camp?"
"My year old assistant, Nina Grabowski..."
...has a summer share in Bridgehampton with other girls.
They have to sleep in shifts.
I can't believe you guys would pass up a chance to get out of this heat.
"Besides, the city's completely dead during August."
That s because everyone's in the Hamptons.
Or stuck in traffic trying to get there.
This could be the Last summer we can actually all get together and do something like this.
"I mean, next year, who knows?"
One of us could be married or have kids.
And we'll always regret that last summer we didn't spend together in the Hamptons.
Charlotte's sweet hopefulness touched something in all of us.
"Fine, but I get the late shift."
Samantha always felt like she was in her ...
...until seeing an actual twenty something brought her down to earth.
"No, I'm getting you on the VIP list."
You have to try it for one night.
My best friend Jerry owns it.
He also owns the one in South Beach.
I need to proof and confirm the guest list for the Hetrick Martin benefit.
"And get me Richard Johnson, ASAP."
"He is not a fag, because I happen to have three friends he's personally fucked."
"I'm sending you a car, to and fro, and if you hate it, I'm gonna let you blow me."
"I have personal relationships of my own, you know."
"Not with my clients, you don't."
I have my career to worry about.
Your career is being my assistant.
I mean you wouldn't even know what's hot if it wasn't for me.
Unfortunately you don't seem to grasp the vast difference between us.
You stood in line at Studio ..
...I stood in line at Studio the movie.
I gave that bitch her first job out of college.
She didn't know a fucking thing
"Girls in their , they're spoiled and ungrateful."
"Don't they realize, we're still it?"
"No, because the world validates their delusion."
And she took a copy of my Rolodex.
Do you think I can sue?
Do you remember us in our ?
The only thing worse than being single in your in this city is being single in your .
I was worried you'd miss the jitney.
The Hamptons Jitney is like the bus to summer camp...
...only instead of singing songs everyone ignores each other and talks on their cell.
"This is Samantha, Carrie and Miranda."
Greg's been going to the Hamptons every summer for years.
"Easy, sister, no need to push."
"Four bumper to bumper hours later, we arrived at our new digs."
"They said this place was shabby chic, I'm thinking it's much more shitty chic."
"Actually, this whole house smells like mildew."
Would you all stop being so cynical?
Now there's one advantage we have over girls in their .
I was cynical in high school.
"It's Greg, that cute guy I met on the jitney."
I told him to drop by.
"And if he asks, he thinks I'm"
"Evidently, while we had taken the Midtown Tunnel..."
...Charlotte had taken the time tunnel.
Me and my housemates are having a big bonfire tonight at the beach...
...and I just wanted to tell you that you're all invited.
There's so much foam you could ski on the head
"Sorry, it's been awhile since I pumped a keg."
"I love young men, but come on."
The guys here they don't even have chest hair yet
That's good news for their backs.
How long do we have to stay?
I'm gonna go tell Charlotte we're leaving.
That s another thing about twenty something girls.
You can always count on one of them to hold your hair when you vomit.
May I just tell you that I worship you?
"I read your column every week, it's like my religion."
"I work as an assistant in a publishing house, but I'm really a writer."
Maybe I could send you something to read sometime?
You have no idea that would mean to me.
To have someone like you as my mentor.
Could I call you sometime in the city?
"If I could just spend some time with you, that would be so cool."
I'll be looking at a very busy summer.
"I'll run errands, I'll do your wash."
I'll just give you my phone number.
"My God, this is so cool."
"The next day, Miranda woke up early to enjoy the cool morning breeze..."
...and a much needed moment of solitude.
"All right, somebody puked on the deck."
Sorry...Stacey and Holly did too many Jell O shots.
"That week, back in the city, I wondered what was the allure of the ?"
"On one hand, there's great skin tone, the thrill of fresh experience..."
...and the sense of a consequence free life full of seemingly endless possibilities.
"While on the other, there are horrible apartments, sexually inexperienced men..."
...and embarrassing errors in fashion judgment.
"Should we fear these freshly minted, single women as a threat to our very survival..."
...or pity them as clueless half wits about to get their dreams dashed...
"And that evening, in my first act as a mentor..."
...I took my young acolyte to a book party.
I can't believe I'm out with Carrie Bradshaw.
"Stop, I can feel my head swelling."
"If it gets any bigger, I'll have to say goodbye to my hats."
Do you think that is too young to write a personal memoir?
"As long as it doesn't deal with incest, Prozac, or partying, no."
"It does deal with sex, or rather not having sex."
It's about how girls my age are saving themselves for marriage.
Are you seriously telling me that you've never had sex with a man?
"Okay, what do you consider sex?"
Are you implying I'm some kind of Lewinsky?
"I'm talking no blowjobs, no hand jobs."
"All right, I get it, no jobs of any kind."
I think I need to get a drink.
A year old virgin was getting me a Cosmopolitan.
The generation gap had never seemed so wide.
Have you actually read the book?
His family has a history of diabetes and he has a steel splint in his left femur.
"My doctor won't even make house calls, let alone attend a book party."
I've never been to one before.
I thought it might be interesting.
"Generally, it's just cheese and crackers."
You never see an actual shrimp.
I'd ask you for a drink after but I'm driving straight to the Hamptons.
I'm actually going out to the Hamptons tomorrow.
"Great, can I call you there?"
I'll be with my friends Saturday at Townline Beach.
You can come by and say hello if you like.
Is this a ploy to see me in my bathing suit?
"Dr. Bradley Meego, this is Laurel."
Now I'm gonna have to buy the book.
"My God, he is such a fox."
Did you just meet him when I was at the bar?
"Lady, you've got it going on"
That Saturday turned out to be hot and sunny.
While we sat under our umbrella...
...twenty something girls sizzled on the sand like rotisserie chickens.
"Excuse me, when did tanning come back in style?"
"Forty five, I didn't know it went up that high."
You could sit in a microwave and not burn.
"It's Charlotte's, but I don't think she s gonnal be using it."
It's not good for her year old image.
Just let her have her fun now.
"Come Labor Day, she's gonna look like a year old handbag."
I'd risk a few precancerous freckles for a summer romance.
"And right then, my summer romance made his appearance, right on schedule."
Yellow umbrellas seem to be very popular this year.
"What kind of a doctor are you, Doctor?"
"General, all purpose kind of thing."
"Fabulous, so you can prescribe medication?"
I'm gonna go take a quick dip.
"You promise not to ditch me, now."
Is that the guy from the book party?
I'm just not really sure I'm interested.
"Good looking, polite, house in the Hamptons."
"Good on paper, bad in bed."
A good on paper guy is a guy with great credentials...
...who you always end up leaving for some hot guy...
...who rides a motorcycle and doesn t have a checking account.
You guys should really go in.
"You better put on some sunscreen, Georgette Hamilton."
"In fact, I've had enough for today."
We can make Long Island Iced Teas.
"Yes, I love Long Island Iced Teas."
I took a leap of faith and made reservations...
...at one of those impossible to get into restaurants for tonight.
I'd love to...I just can't abandon my friends.
"I've got a great little house, cute porch we could sit on."
"Okay, how about I just call your..."
...in case of emergency number this weekend.
"The emergency being, I think I'm gonna miss you."
"Yes, you could definitely do that."
"Romantic, polite, and his very own house south of the highway."
My good on paper guy was jumping right off the page.
"Later that afternoon, we came back from the beach rested, rejuvenated..."
Even Miranda was in good spirits.
"Guys, I just got back from the market."
Fresh corn and seafood for dinner.
I only got enough for the four of us.
"Yeah, she was asking too many inane questions."
I sent her up to your room.
"I've got to go shower, the sand is itchy in my bathing suit, and then I m gonna help you."
It's for the Hamptons Hoedown tomorrow night...
...and the event is being run by Nina G. Public Relations.
"Overnight, Samantha's ex assistant, Nina Grabowski..."
...had reinvented herself as Nina G.
I was up for that job and now she's using my Rolodex to put together the guest list.
While Samantha was getting fucked royally by her protege...
...mine was giving me the royal treatment.
It's not that I don't wanna have sex with men...
...I feel like these previous generations of women have...
...devalued sex to the point where it's not even special anymore.
"One summer, when I was I read everything Jackie Collins ever wrote."
"I thought to myself, who cares?"
Is it supposed to be shocking...
...wagging one's pussy at every good looking stud who walks by?
And what is it you like about my column?
"I have a tiny tick on my stomach, and I can't get it off."
"My God, that is not a tick."
Charlotte really is in her .
"That night, I called Dr. Meego."
I figured it was an emergency.
I have this thing about crabs.
I had them once in college and the experience scarred me for life.
I really I don t think I can go back to that house until the mattresses are sanitized...
...and the sheets and towels are burned.
I'm flattered you thought of me.
I'd be happy to prescribe your friend some industrial strength pubicide.
She can take care of herself.
You might have to spend the night here.
"I might have to, but only to sleep."
Women always say that and as soon as the lights go out...
"...boom, they're going right for my pajamas."
"That night we slept together, but we didn't sleep together."
I believe it was the first instance of a case of crabs moving a relationship forward.
"Every year, one of the local Hamptons billionaires got down and dirty..."
...and threw a big hoedown full of cowboys and caviar.
It was the event of the season.
We joined Samantha to lend our moral support.
There're people here who don't even come to my parties and they came to Nina's.
I am just so depressed right now.
I may need her to hire me someday.
While Samantha set out to negotiate twenty something detente...
...Charlotte prepared to launch a full out war.
Do you know that you gave me crabs?
What makes you think it was me?
So is Iying about your age.
I saw your driver license when you bought the beer last night.
"You made an assumption, I didn't contradict it."
"I may have given you crabs, but you deceived me."
"That doesn't mean wait, it means go"
I just stopped by to wish you good luck.
That is very cool of you.
I told you not to seat Martha near the hayride.
Could you please try to keep the young people out until after
"We're all out of country fried goat cheese, somebody got stuck with a cactus needle..."
...and there are people outside who aren't on the fucking list.
That's not supposed to happen until midnight.
"I can't, they're on a fucking barge"
I need to get everybody outside.
I think the two of you would really hit it off.
"I began to realize, that the biggest threat twenty something girls posed..."
I've been looking all over for you.
"Look, I got one just like yours."
You want me to get you a Cosmopolitan?
I'm gonna go find my date.
"But I'll see you later, okay?"
"My God, he was so cute."
They were simply our youthful doppelgangers...
...who needed our compassion more than anything.
And then everything I so firmly believed was promptly blown to pieces.
I just got back this week from Paris.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.
Natasha's parents have a house in East Hampton.
We just came up for the weekend.
"I'm sorry, I'm just a little stunned here."
She's this girl that I met in Paris.
She works for Ralph Lauren in Europe.
You're in from Paris for the weekends?
I certainly didn't want to run into you like this.
"I'm here on a date, too, somewhere."
"He's good on paper, probably like Natasha."
"Good looking, sweet, blah blah blah."
I'll see you in the Hamptons or back in the city.
I promise to call when I get back into town.
"No, I just ran into Big."
...twenty something girls are just fabulous...
...until you see one with the man who broke your heart.
Life is all about making choices.
"Some choices, like who you marry, are big..."
"The ones that last three days, or the ones that last five days?"
Another choice is how to deal with an ex boyfriend.
"Some women handle it coolly, calmly, while others...."
Like a kid in one of those big eyed velvet paintings.
"What was I gonna do, stand around and chit chat about the weather?"
"The man's been inside me, for god s sake."
Could I have more Sweet n Low?
I've never been able to be friends with an ex boyfriend.
"I meet those couples who stay friends and I think, How do they do that?"
I've never been able to be friends with any men.
"Women are for friendships, men are for fucking."
"Honey, you gotta learn to form an opinion."
Friendship is the bonus of a relationship.
"If they don t want relationship, they don t get to be friends."
"If you don t make it a couple, you withhold friendship as a punishment?"
You make it sound so bad.
Black widow spiders bite the heads off their mates when they re still with them.
Withholding friendship is letting them off easy.
"How can you imagine you guys, instead of the whole awful break up scene..."
"...just like you say, hey, you, come here ...and chomp their head off."
I would love to be one of those people who's all:
"But I'm much more: We didn't work out, you need to not exist. What?"
"I mean, we keep dresses we'll never wear again but we throw away our ex boyfriends."
I'm not saying that I'm any better.
"I haven't been able to be friends with Big, but...."
If you loved someone and you break up...where does the love go?
There is no way the love that I had with Big is same thing he has with Natasha.
When'd you stop calling her the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul?
About three weeks ago when I saw them at Cafe M.
He was holding her hand and smiling and...I finally got it.
"Later that night, I got to thinking about the ex factor."
"In mathematics, we learned that x stands for the unknown."
But what's really unknown is: what plus what equals friendship with an ex?
Or is it possible to transform a once passionate love...
...into something that fits nice and easily onto the friendship shelf?
I couldn t help but wonder...can you be friends with an ex?
"That Sunday afternoon, Miranda was sitting at home enjoying a biscotti and the paper when..."
"That was a shitty thing you did, running away from me on the street."
I wasn't expecting to see you
I don't do very well with ex boyfriends and...
I held your head while you were sleeping.
I hadn't seen you in so long and I missed you and then I did that shitty thing.
You are not a shitty person.
You'd never do anything that shitty.
How do you call showing up at your apartment in the middle of afternoon and calling you shitty?
You've got a bat in the cave.
"Whenever something funny happens, I always want to tell you about it."
"Just cause we could make it a couple doesn't mean we can't have a friendly meal, does it?"
"Looking forward to it, are you?"
As Miranda made plans to have dinner with her last love...
"...Charlotte came face to face with the memory of her first...her horse, Taddy."
Charlotte's relationship with Taddy ended sadly...
...when he threw her during a teen equestrian competition...
...causing her to break her collarbone and lose the blue ribbon.
Her father promptly sold Taddy to another family and she hadn't been on a horse since.
Charlotte wondered if it was time to get back in the saddle again.
"Meanwhile, across town...Samantha was about to see a stallion of her own."
"I gotta tell you, you look amazing."
"Excuse me, but do I know you?"
I was thinking maybe you'd have dinner with me sometime.
The way you were just checking me out.
Do I also get your phone number?
I'll tell you what...Here's my business card.
Blatantly picking a woman up on the street.
How'd you get to be so cocky?
"I was born that way, I guess."
At least consider meeting me for a friendly little drink.
"I'll think about it, Mr. Cocky."
"It was later that week, when I spotted a Laura Ashley dress, circa .."
...that I decided it was time to give my ex a friendly phone call.
I hadn't planned on the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul answering.
"Then, I remembered Big had caller ID."
"Yes, but I didn't get to talk because..."
"...I accidentally hit the thing...so, you know, it hung up."
"And I...I heard Natasha, so, apologize to her."
Can't you let one go by?
Maybe I'd...do better if I went with my little prepared speech.
"You have a speech, do you?"
I was wondering what you thought of...
...instead of pretending each other doesn't exist...
...we try to be friends or something?
"I've been meaning to call you, but I didn t know if you wanted to hear from me"
Want to have a lunch or something?
I used to make our lunch reservations in Big's name.
"But today, I put it in mine, because that's what friends do."
The other party is already here.
"I got up at worked out, hardly had any breakfast."
They have a great Cobb salad here.
"And that's when I realized, Big was nervous."
The new friend part of me felt incredibly compassionate...
...while the old girlfriend part of me felt incredibly smug.
The Cobb salad is very good here.
Can I get you something to drink?
"An hour later, I had solved the unsolvable friendship equation."
It seems the answer is this:
Cosmopolitans plus scotch equals friendship with an ex.
"If I had to listen to freaking Blood, Sweat Tears one more time...."
"Blood, Sweat Tears is great stuff."
"Go ahead, friend, tell me about the girl."
Don't tell me about the girl.
Maybe we should make a pact:
We don't talk about our relationships until they get really serious something.
I wanted you to hear it from me.
I just got a splitting headache.
I didn't know how to tell you...
"You have a problem with commitment, remember?"
"In fact, you told me you never wanted to get married again, ever."
You just didn't want to marry me.
Don't you dare say her name to me
You string me along for two years...
...then you marry some year old girl after only five months?
I did not string you along.
You are the one end it like this.
I was trying to be friendly.
This seems like a much better way to end things.
"Be engaged, get married to...Nijinsky or whatever her name is."
"Don't worry about me, I'm fine."
"The next day, I had promised to hold Charlotte's hand while she attempted to go riding."
"It turned out, she needed to hold mine as well."
Aside from the fact that my ex is engaged to a teenager...
...and I've got horseshit on my goddamn shoes...I'm doing okay.
I would be in a hospital or something.
What the fuck is his problem?
Some horses never really like to be ridden.
"Taddy was like that when I first got him, but once I broke him in, he loved it."
I broke him in and the Idiot Stick Figure With No Soul gets to ride him.
"You see, this is what happens."
You try to be friendly with an ex and you wind up knee deep in shit
"Taddy was brown, but he had white spots on his flank."
"Just stay till I'm on the horse, then you can go, okay?"
Foot in and up you go.
As Charlotte placed her boot in the stirrup...
"...all her bad memories of Taddy, broken bones and ribbons flooded over her."
After a few get to know each other phone calls...
...Samantha took up Mr. Cocky on his offer of a friendly drink.
"Turns out, it was a very friendly drink."
"I want you to know, I never pick up guys on the street...unless they're very cute."
"Get over here, you cutie you."
Before we go any further...I gotta warn you about something.
Most women just can't handle it.
Samantha suddenly understood what made Mr. Cocky so cocky.
"I'm telling you, it was like a wall of flesh coming at me."
Nothing is scarier than a really big one coming at you.
"I didn't even want my mouth near it, I was afraid I'd get lockjaw."
Don't tell me you believe that.
I'm really going to have to psych myself up before I try it again.
You're going to try it again?
"It's a penis, not Mount Everest."
...Last night I could only make it to Base Camp One.
"You dated Big, I'm dating Mr. Too Big."
"You broke up with James because he was too small, this guy is too big."
I'm looking for one that's just right.
"That night, after a friendly dinner..."
...Steve and Miranda began to explore their newfound friendship.
"If you were a real friend, you'd let me keep it."
"Sorry, it's one of the conditions of our break up."
You gotta give me back my fire department shirt.
Thanks for coming out for dinner.
"Thanks for letting me pay, finally."
"That's what friends do, isn't it?"
"That's what friends do, isn't it?"
I got another question for you.
"We had good reasons for breaking up, right?"
And in a bed across town....
After two yoga classes and a hit of the best Hawaiian gold she could find...
...Samantha was ready to take another run at Mount Everest.
You mean we're not there yet?
"And just like that, Samantha made her very first male friend."
"The next day in Central Park, Charlotte was making a new friend as well."
She had decided she and Pal were moving too fast.
"Before going any further, they needed to slow down and get to know each other better."
I loved my Taddy so much.
And with that gentle nudge from her new pal...
...all Charlotte's bad feelings about Taddy lifted...
...and she remembered just how much she had loved his cute white spots.
"Hey, it's Carrie, I'm shoe shopping."
I'm calling to say I feel bad about last week.
I didn't mean for it to happen like that...I thought you needed to know.
I hated the idea someone else might tell you.
I feel like a real shit.
I'm really sorry...I would never hurt you deliberately.
"Like I was saying, I'm sorry."
I shouldn't have reacted like that.
I guess it was a shock I needed to hear to move on.
I wish you all the best.
I hope you and Natasha will be very happy.
I hope...some day very soon...we can all meet for a drink and be great friends.
Like they do in the movies.
"And I actually managed to hold onto those friendly feelings, until...."
I can't believe my ex boyfriend is blocks away at the Plaza right now...
I can t believe he had the nerve to invite you.
I had to make the big let's be friends speech.
"Big and I were never friends, we were something else."
Something that apparently did not end with an engagement party at the Plaza.
I think I can actually feel them over there eating shrimp.
Robert Hubbell Redford in The Way We Were.
"I love, love, love, that movie."
How could you have not seen it the way we were?
Robert Redford is madly in love with Barbara Streisand.
"But he can't be with her because she's too complicated...and she has wild, curly hair."
He leaves her and marries this...simple girl with straight hair.
"Ladies, I am having an epiphany."
The world is made of two types of women:
The simple girls and the Katie girls.
I'm a Katie girl and where are our drinks?
I always cry at the last scene in that movie...
...when she sees him in her hotel with his new wife
"She says to him: Your girl is lovely, Hubbell."
"Oh my, God, it's so good."
Light the corners of my mind
Let me do my favorite part.
Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time re written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
"After I left my friends, I found myself pulled to the site of the Big engagement party."
"I had no intention of going in, but it was on my way home."
I could run or I could stand and ask him the question...
"...that if I didn t ask, would haunt me the rest of my life."
"I thought by the time I got here, I'd know what to say."
I was just on my way home and...I have a question for you.
I really need to hear you say it.
It just got so hard...and she's...
"Then I had a thought, maybe I didn't break Big."
Maybe the problem was he couldn't break me.
Maybe some women aren't meant to be tamed.
Maybe they need to run free until they find someone...just as wild to run with.
"Home to one million exciting, eligible, single men and four cold and slightly cranky single women."
We're actually crossing water to meet men.
"Reminder, I am not going to Staten lsland to meet men."
I am going to judge them.
A perk of being a minor celebrity is that you get invited to major events.
Like NewYork fire department's annual calendar competition.
This is a long way to go to watch some firemen take their shirts off.
I better see more than pecs.
I don't understand why they couldn't hold the competition in a bar in Manhattan.
They have firemen on the Upper East Side too.
And they only put out top notch fires.
Look at how small it looks.
Who would have thought an island that tiny would be big enough to hold all our old boyfriends.
He loves to cook and can whip up a great baked ziti.
He's from engine ladder way out there in Queens.
on a scale of how many?
"He was a divorced politician, campaigning for New York City Comptroller."
His wife Maria said he's a good guy but he works too hard.
"oK, they don't make cosmopolitans, it's a Staten lsland iced tea."
Is that like a Long lsland iced tea?
Do we have to be this close?
You gotta be in it to win it.
I can't see the cute firemen from back there without my glasses.
"There is no having of the Steve, we're just friends."
I don't put my dick in you.
Another one of these and I might let you.
There are no datable men here.
The pleather jackets or smell of High Karate ?
"Yes, ladies, that's a cheetah on his arm."
Ricky represents engine in Lower Manhattan.
I'd like to show him my Lower Manhattan.
"Look at his arms, they're huge."
"After the contest, I began to realize that Staten lsland was like a quaint European country."
The American music was years behind and you could smoke wherever you wanted.
Are those shirts are for sale?
I'd like to get one for my nephew.
"I got this one at work, but I'm sure you could buy 'em at other places."
I've seen them in those shops
I never did anything like that.
"My sisters said, Do it, Ricky ."
"And I said, l never did anything like that before ."
I wonder what month you'll be.
"I bet July, or any month that's hot."
"Two songs later, it was time for this dancing queen to take a breather."
How's that working out for you?
I allow myself one a week.
"You live right on the edge, don't you?"
Can I buy you a beer
For helping me out in there.
"And by the way, you have the worst taste in men ever."
You gave that guy from Midtown a
I like a firefighter with love handles to hold on to when escaping a burning building.
And what's with the half points?
Sometimes a girl needs a half.
"So, which district do you vote in?"
You've never voted in New York City?
I can tell you your district.
I thought all honest politicians lived in studios and ate beans out of a can.
I'm not a fan of beans.
Can I get your phone number?
I'm just here with my friends having a good time.
I'm not into dating right now.
"Actually, it was a silence and a half."
Would it help if I took my shirt off?
And is that a bad thing?
He's just way too I'm the guy .
I don't want to have to tell you this.
I saw him give someone a thumbs up.
Samantha went home with that firefighter.
How many cocktails did she have?
"And so, three girls headed home, taking only fond memories of Staten lsland and its infamous iced teas."
I held her head in the taxi.
I'm nice I'm pretty and I'm smart.
I'm gonna meet the perfect guy and get married.
Did you hear that New York?
I'm getting married and here I come
If she falls over I will never stop laughing.
I Wasn't quite sure if it Was the iced teas or the Staten lsland dating pool that broke the camel's back.
But something set Charlotte on fire.
"And uptown on dry land, Samantha and Mr."
July had their own fire going.
I believe the official fire department count is a four alarmer .
"The next morning at breakfast, Miranda and I wanted poached eggs, Samantha wanted to give us the details and Charlotte wanted to keep her head from exploding over her raincoat."
"I'm telling you, no guy has ever gotten me that wet."
Let me tell you about his cock.
The people at the next table have a child.
Can we spare the cock talk till cocktail time?
I wanted you to know my fireman was every bit the fantasy I had in mind.
I think it's wrong to sleep with a man just to fulfill a fantasy.
All the men we sleep with fulfill a certain fantasy.
You fantasize of a man with a fancy apartment and a stock portfolio.
"For me, it's a fireman with a big hose."
Even when they're not that cute they're still cute.
You see him on that truck
They've got that I'm a good guy look in their eyes.
It's because women want to be rescued.
"The sentence independent single women in their thirties are never supposed to think, let alone say out loud."
I've been dating since I was where is he?
Did you ever think that maybe we're the white knights and we're the ones that have to save ourselves?
Later that day I got to thinking about fairytales.
What if Prince Charming had never showed up?
Would SnowWhite have slept in that glass coffin forever?
"or would she have eventually woken up, spit out the apple, gotten a job, a healthcare package and a baby from her local sperm bank?"
"While for some women the idea of rescue was a life raft, for Miranda it was an insult."
I don't need anybody to help me.
You'll be sedated and your vision will be blurred.
You will need someone to get you home and to bed.
"Then take two sleeping pills, sleep for hours."
Wake up and you'll be able to see perfectly.
I can't believe I'm gonna wake up and see clearly without glasses or contacts for the first time.
They slit your eyeball open and flip up the top.
Just Iike the top of a grape.
You want me to come down and hold your hand?
I do not need anyone to hold my hand.
I'm not saying you need anyone.
I'd just like to be there.
Why do you have to ask Carrie when I'm offering?
"Because, you know, Carrie is my friend."
"Steve, after they flip the eye up, these jets"
"And over on the East Side at a more Charlotte friendly bar, the ice tea princess began her quest for a white knight."
How am I gonna meet him?
We got here ten minutes ago.
Can I buy those sweet lips a drink?
Charlotte was a firm believer in the laws of dating feng shui.
Why is it always a guy like that?
Into every life a little J.
"I just want a nice, sweet, handsome, funny, great guy, who doesn't say things like sweet lips."
Is that too much to ask?
Let me buy you a drink.
I'll even buy blondie here one.
"He was a nice, sweet, handsome, great investment banker who lived between Madison and Fifth."
"So, maybe there really were white knights."
"The day after Charlotte met her knight, I met my credit card limit."
"With no man in sight, I decided to rescue my ankles from a life of boredom by purchasing too many pairs of Jimmy Choo shoes."
"Hello, my name is Bill Kelley and I'm gonna be your city comptroller."
I brought some voter registration forms.
You're like a Jehovah's Witness with a good suit.
How long have you been here?
I'm not showing you a shoe.
It's for the city of New York.
I really am one of the good guys.
I'm carrying all the boroughs but I need help with Staten lsland.
"No, I had one on Thursday."
I gotta go back out there to do a schmooze at the Capri restaurant on Sunday night and I want you to go with me.
"And also, for the record I can't stop thinking about you."
"That Saturday, when I was unable to take Miranda to her laser surgery due to a looming column deadline, she didn't call Steve."
She decided to take things into her own hands.
"Who needs a man to hold your hand, when you have cab fare and a black marker to write down emergency numbers?"
"And while Miranda was under the knife, Charlotte was having her first glass of white wine with her white knight."
"I did the Hasty Pudding show a couple of times, to blow off steam."
My friend Tom says that Harvard is still the most aggressive place he's seen.
That's my idea of a perfect marriage.
"Charlotte nodded, thinking what a nice, sweet, handsome, funny, great couple they made."
"Excuse me, you just bumped into her chair."
"Yes, but you bumped her chair."
That's no way to treat a lady.
"Charlotte realized that her date wasn't a man who came to women's rescue, he was a man who liked to start fights."
You want a piece of me?
"And just like that, Charlotte's white knight changed into a white nightmare"
"Miss Hobbes, your friend is here."
Carrie thought you might need some help.
Just don't let me hit the door frame and never mention these goggles.
"one cab ride and two sleeping pills later, Steve put Miranda to bed."
"Put your feet in, Sleeping Beauty."
"The next morning, after what felt like a hundred years, Miranda awoke."
"And for the first time in her life, she sawthings clearly."
July invited Samantha to come down and hang with him while he worked the Sunday shift.
"The idea being in a firehouse filled with a calendar hot firemen, was a fantasy, Samantha felt, whose time had definitely come."
This was not the firehouse fantasy Samantha had in mind.
I just put a pot of chilli on.
Samantha's rescue fantasy was suddenly something she needed to be rescued from.
"Hey, I'm still down here in the car."
I'll wait ten more seconds and then I'll go alone.
"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, poor me five, four, three, two one."
"one and a half, sometimes a girl needs a half."
"oK, that was my best shot, you're not coming."
"I'm standing here, fully dressed, watching that politician guy drive off to Staten lsland without me."
You're terrified of getting hurt again.
"The phrase single, independent women in their thirties are never supposed to think."
I was like a woman frozen on the ledge of a building on fire.
"I'd been so burned in my last relationship, I Was afraid to leap off into the next one."
A woman on my block won't pick up after her poodle.
I'll see what I can do.
"And, Mr. President, it was a bad break up."
So I need to take this slow.
"Somewhere between the chilli and half time, Samantha decided if she wanted her firehouse fantasy to happen, she'd have to make it happen."
Samantha rode the pole a couple of times that night.
Why are these boots set up like this?
So we'll be ready at a moment's notice.
"Well, I should be a fireman, because I am always ready to go."
Get the fuck out of my gear
"Move, lady, it's a fuckin' fire"
Samantha learned there's quite a difference between a rescue fantasy and a rescue reality.
Are you sure I can't give you a ride?
You go You go and do your thing.
It's almost I'm gonna miss the last ferry.
"He didn't have a white horse, but he did have a BMW with a working heater."
"So I guess, sometimes a woman absolutely has to be rescued."
You're taking me home and that's it.
"Now, any idea howwe get the fuck off this island?"
"And sometimes, a woman absolutely has to rescue a man."
"At least, that's how it ends in this Staten lsland fairytale."
I had been dating politician Bill Kelley for three weeks.
"Since most of our time was spent campaigning, I dressed the part."
I found some vintage Halston and did a spin on Jackie Kennedy.
Who here knows what a city comptroller does?
"I was adept at fashion, he at politics."
"This city's populace's passion, Iove and devotion to their home"
"Really, they're both about recycling ideas and making them seem fresh and inspiring."
"It is this love affair, this symbiotic relationship between citizens and city, that I promise to cherish and protect."
You and me in the bedroom
And that's whatever position you want.
That was the night I had my political consciousness raised.
How about a movie Wednesday night?
"Steve, you can't just assume I'm gonna be free every night."
"It could be a date, so I wouldn't necessarily share that with you."
I'm trying to figure out when I get to see you again
I'm not planning on dating anyone else.
I just want to see you.
I just hadn't thought about things that way.
"Because I think if we really want to see if it can work between us, this time we got to make the commitment to be exclusive."
"The truth was, there were no other candidates in sight."
But Miranda wasn't ready to let Steve win by default.
You're dating a politician and you're not even registered to vote.
"He's good looking, he's got power It's got to be a turn on."
"Yeah, I'm dating a potential comptroller."
It's a great way to meet men.
"With Carrie, we can meet the inner circle and the interesting donors."
By interesting men she means single and rich.
"Guys, he's not running for president."
I always vote according to looks.
I base my decision on the swimsuit competition.
The country runs better with a good looking man in charge Look at Nixon.
"No one wanted to fuck him, so he fucked everyone."
I had a crush on Dan Quayle.
We need a president in a hat.
"Really, they're both about recycling ideas and making them seem fresh and inspiring."
"FDR, good president, wore a hat."
"So busy picking a hat, he forgot to get in the war."
I had a crush on Dan Quayle.
We tried to ignore that the first time.
"It was his crisp, white shirts."
"So, you were voting for your father."
There was something homoerotic about Quayle and Bush.
"Based strictly on looks, no one was cuter than JFK."
or quicker to jump in the sack.
I'm glad you three weren't around during the original colonies.
I don't think our founding fathers were very fuckable.
I heard that Thomas Jefferson was a real fox.
"Meanwhile, Miranda was facing a day at the polls earlier than she expected."
"Last night as we were walking home, Steve asked me to go steady."
I don't know if I can make that commitment.
How many other guys are you dating?
I'm so ambivalent about Steve and moving forward.
You did let him back in your life.
Flaws that make me not want to stick my neck out.
Maybe I should be honest and tell him what I really feel which is.
what if somebody better comes along?
You gotta put a better spin on it than that.
I don't know how to be political in relationships.
Politics were always as relevant to me as a new Erica Jong novel.
But I did find it interesting that a discussion about politics ultimately became a discussion about sex.
And a discussion about sex became a question of politics.
"Which led me to wonder, if the two were inextricably linked, and if so can there be sex without politics?"
"That night, Samantha discovered her own hot, new candidate."
can I buy that for you?
"Maybe, if you promise never to use a lame line like that again."
And that is not a line.
How long have you been sitting here?
I run a successful hedge fund.
My life is about calculating risks.
Telling a beautiful lady she's attractive is the safest bet I've made all day.
We have a house in Sun Valley.
How long have you been skiing?
You've got the legs for it.
Got to run back to the office.
I told you all about me but I didn't hear about you.
There were gorgeous women sitting on either side and Jeff had elected her.
Who's gonna say no to you?
Just as her self esteem was soaring right off the charts
"Nice to meet you, Pink Lady."
"Later that week, I brought the single ladies coalition to elect Bill Kelley to a fundraiser."
What is the height difference between a short person and a little person?
Little person is the proper way to refer to an adult under feet.
I agreed to go on a date with a very short person.
I didn't realize he was so short.
"Standing, he barely clears my nipples."
That may be the perfect height.
I can't cancel just because he's a munchkin.
This is a politically incorrect conversation for a political fundraiser.
Less than five feet is unacceptable.
There are a lot of cute guys here and these things never last beyond two martinis.
Charlotte was running her own campaign.
She wanted to be elected wife before the year was out.
"Tell me, Why are we voting for this guy?"
"He wants an investigation into the Board of Education for waste, and he's against large corporations wasting your tax dollars"
"Jesus christ, he talks more than I do."
This is the lovely Miranda Hobbes.
I've heard great things about you.
You must be reading my clippings.
I pay people a lot to say nice things.
"If you win, maybe you can fix a couple of parking tickets."
I figured I need the money more than they do.
"come on, he knows I'm kidding."
I don't believe in the Republican Party or Democratic Party.
"Charlotte was stumping for her cause, and making newfriends."
But I loved comic books as a kid.
His work is accessible on so many levels.
"Charlotte, this is my fiancee catherine."
"I can only stay a few minutes, I have tickets to the Vagina Monologues ."
"I don't eat at the restaurant, but I can still hear the specials."
"Carrie, give me a sip of your drink."
"This is my friend, Stanford Blatch."
"If you can carry chelsea, you've got the city locked up."
How do you even know he's gay?
I've seen him rollerblading on h Avenue.
"Great, now I'm a first lady and a pimp"
"This is awkward, so feel free to stop me at any time, but there's a person here who would like to meet you."
It's the guy right over there.
You mean the blonde guy with the great arms.
"It's the bald guy, with the great sense of humor."
He's really much more my type.
I wondered howto handle this political hot potato.
I could have sworn he was.
I realized I was getting good at politics.
I'm just so at the place where I'm ready to settle down.
It seems like a miracle when two nice people like you can find each other.
We met in the most unusual way.
one of my girlfriends threw a party Where all the women brought a man they weren't interested in.
one woman's trash is another woman's treasure.
It really got him in the mood.
"You know, you're the first woman in ages I've felt this intimate with."
I love making love to you.
Is there anything you want or need that I'm not doing?
I want to make you happy.
Is there anything you want or need that I'm not doing?
"Well, I would love to get you in the shower."
Get each other all fresh and clean.
And then I'd like you to pee on me.
It's typical of men in power.
"I told him I'd just gone, maybe another time."
I can't keep saying that forever.
"I peed on a guy once during sex, but it was an accident."
I once had to stop eating meat for six months.
"So this is what it's come down to ready, set, pee?"
Sometimes with the right guy you have to make concessions.
Are you advocating that I do this?
He's a great looking political prince.
The Princess And The Pee .
"If you can't work it out with Bill, bring him to my party on Friday."
Everyone is bringing a guy they're no longer interested in.
"That's a great idea, I can bring my short guy."
You're dating a munchkin and I'm following the yellow brick road.
"A couple of nights later, and no closer to a solution, I had a date with Bill."
"We went to his favorite lndian restaurant, that boasted the hottest curry in the city."
So I just got some new polls.
I'm ahead in Manhattan and Brooklyn but I'm lagging in the Bronx.
I may have to spend another to buy myself some voter turnout.
"Excuse me, can I get another one?"
"So, I read your column yesterday."
Who's the handsome politico you refer to?
He's just some other fellow I'm seeing in washington
My life is an open book.
What I love about the column is the way you feel about it.
Even if I can't put it in print like you.
I am so crazy about you.
I was hoping we could spend the night together but I have an early meeting with the Brooklyn That's no problem.
"That Friday night, Charlotte threw her used date party ."
There are so many eligible men here.
can I get you something to drink?
You said to bring a man you're not interested in.
You're making a mockery of this party.
Is he the smallest man you've ever seen?
If you'll excuse me I have to meet my eligible guests
I've got to get busy too.
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
"I figured, before I finalize the list, I should see what's out there"
I'm guessing that's Samantha's little friend.
You gotta go to cuba now.
Another year will be too late.
can't you get arrested for going?
I'll e mail you some of my pictures.
"Very nice to meet you, Greg Miller."
You brought me here to dump me?
"I thought, maybe you could meet someone your own size."
"Sweetheart, give me an hour in bed, you'll swear I'm the Jolly Green Giant."
I'm the best you've ever had.
She felt so politically incorrect about dumping a man for his height.
She felt she had to sleep with him.
"If these guys are in their thirties and these women don't want them, there might just be a little something for me."
I took the year off after business school.
Trekked the old spice trail in Asia.
"Talking to Greg, Charlotte felt like she had unearthed a rare coin that some other woman had discarded."
"This is my ex, Belinda Peters, she hooked me up on this thing."
You must be a friend of Karen's.
Thanks for bringing this great man.
can I talk to you for a minute?
"once Melinda saw Greg talking to another woman, he suddenly looked all shiny and new again."
"That night, Jeff proved to Samantha that he more than made up for his shortcomings."
Samantha told us later it was like having sex with a horny smurf.
"Meanwhile, across town, Steve was busy stuffing Miranda's ballot box."
"You know, I'm not looking for a quick answer in the monogamy thing."
It's probably something that's got to happen on its own.
It's just that I wanted you to know how I feel.
You're the best woman I've ever met.
I want you to knowto know that.
Steve had just said the one big pro that outweighed all the cons.
"Later that week, Samantha put her heels away and gave Jeff a chance."
It was one thing to date a man who went to the little boy's room.
Another to date one who still shopped at the little boy's department.
"Look, Jeff I can't do this."
I don't want to lead you on.
You came five times the other night.
What happened in the past five minutes?
You shop at the boy's department.
"The clothes fit me better, plus they're cheaper."
"Where do you shop, the big and tall whore store?"
You're nothing but a big dick with a little man attached.
You're nothing but a big dick with a little man attached.
"You're nothing but a big pair of tits, with too much extra leg room."
"Surprisingly, Samantha had found what she was really looking for."
And it had nothing to do with size.
Somebody get me a booster chair.
She'd found a man who made her laugh.
"Though he was short, it was a long relationship for Samantha."
"That night, parched and nervous, I spent another night with Bill."
"come on, let's take a shower."
"come on, get in while it's hot."
can I talk to you about something?
"I've been giving this peeing thing a lot of thought, and while I think it's totally fine that that's what you're into, I just It's just never really been my thing."
"Yeah, so I thought instead, maybe you could close your eyes and I could dribble warm tea on you."
ormaybe you might think it's fun to hear the sound of running water when we have sex.
"And, if things got really serious between us, I could maybe, even, leave the bathroom door open sometime."
"Although, I'm really not sure how comfortable I'd be with that either."
"You know, there's something I want to tell you too."
Some people connected with the campaign read your column and they had a different take on it.
"They said it was funny and clever, but that it was a lot about sex."
They don't think I should date a sex columnist before the election.
They thought it was kind of seamy.
"Wait a second, I may write about sex, but you like people to pee on you."
"Yeah, but nobody knows about that."
I realized that politics had entered my bedroom as well as my bathroom.
I decided that my bravest political act would be to tell the truth.
I didn't use his real name.
It was much more political not to
There are fewthings I love as much as Sunday brunch.
You can sleep till noon and still get eggs anywhere in the city.
And it's the one day you get the single woman's sports' pages The New York Times wedding section.
The oldest woman on this page is
Now I'm depressed and I haven't had coffee yet.
At least you have a boyfriend.
That only means I'm getting laid.
"Until recently, the bride, worked as a supervisor at Ogilvy Mather."
I love how they say until recently .
Meaning she quit her job once she found her soul mate investment banker.
I've got a rock on my finger.
Now I can stop pretending to care about my career.
"Until recently, the bride had a life of her own."
"The higher the number, the worse the sex."
How bad must Henry Vlll have been
"You give him head, he cuts yours off"
This couple met on a bike tour.
I just make it through spinning.
It's amazing how upset women get over the marital status of strangers.
Then there's the occasional familiar face.
They had an engagement party at the Plaza.
Why is their wedding like a short story?
This is what I hate about The Sunday Times .
This and the country houses I can't afford.
You want to rent a movie?
I'm not gonna slit my wrists.
I just thought you might want some company.
I think I want to be alone.
"OK, I'm just gonna take the paper."
I know what you're gonna do.
You'll cry and it'll be awful.
Let's read it now and get it over with.
"The couple met in Paris, on the lle St Louis."
"How original, they fell in love in Paris."
"l was alone at a cafe when the waiter brought over a bottle of Pinot Noir from a handsome man at the bar , the bride said, her eyes sparkling."
"When we'd finished the wine, I knew I wanted to marry him."
You were drunk and he was rich.
"Marry they did, in Southampton at the bride's parents' estate."
And The New York Times .
I don't hear Big anywhere in this article.
She's calling the shots and he's just along for the ride.
"The bride Carried calla lilies, tied with a red ribbon."
As she walked down the aisle a saxophone played When A Man Loves A Woman .
What I wouldn't give for a working fireplace.
He wasn't the right man for you.
"You know, she's just you know, shiny hair, style section Vera Wang."
And I'm the sex column they run next to ads for penile implants.
Big wasn't the only one taking the plunge.
"After more than a decade of domestic independence, Miranda had opened up to a relationship Good morning."
Do you know where the coffee mugs are?
I guess that makes more sense.
"I always drink coffee out of my law school class of 'mug, because it's bigger, and It's just what I always use."
I bring you nice herbal teas.
"Oh, thank you very much, but I prefer coffee."
Why do I have a rolling pin?
It's for you to make pies.
It's good for women to make pies.
Do you have a rolling pin?
I use my oven for storage.
My cleaning lady brought me one.
She couldn't believe I didn't have one.
I can't believe you have a cleaning lady.
I hate being home when she is.
"I feel like if I'm home, I should be cleaning or making pies."
She says that's what women do.
"Where did you find her, in a time capsule?"
I don't need to make pies.
I'm practically a partner in a major lawfirm.
"If I want pie, I can buy it."
I think I need this in a smaller size.
"I'll get it for you, just hand it out, there's no need Carrie?"
"Big, all five foot ten of her."
"I heardI read Congratulations on the thing, on the wedding."
"That looks nice, what you have on there."
I need something for this Women ln The Arts luncheon I helped organize.
"You know, I write, so I am a woman in the arts."
I go to that lunch every year in clothes.
"Now, I can't find the invitation."
Why did you say you'd go?
"I've talked to her twice, once in a cowboy hat, and once in my bra."
Like freakin' Annie get your clothes on.
I would just like her to see me looking normal.
I would prefer to look amazing.
"Not like I'm trying, just effortlessly striking."
And will Big be at this event?
It's a Women In The Arts luncheon.
"It's not about Big, it's about Natasha."
It seems to be a lot of trouble for a woman.
Can you help me find out when and where it is?.
"I can do better than that, I'm coming too"
"So, you support women in the arts?"
"I support you, and these bitches need to be put in their places."
That night I modeled my wardrobe in my head and vetoed everything.
Why did I care so much?
What was it about Natasha that made me feel like the charity case?
"Was it just that she had Big, or was this bigger than Big?"
Are there women in New York just there to make us feel bad about ourselves?
"For Miranda, that woman was a certain Ukrainian housekeeper."
"It's gift, to make your bathroom nicer."
It used to be under the sink.
Last week I organize for you.
"No, that drawer doesn't need organizing."
Magda had discovered Miranda's goodie drawer .
"I have a boyfriend, so it's not like I'm sleeping with lots of different men."
For a long time there was no guy and that's why I have the other thing.
You want to marry this man?
I don't know if I want to get married.
I don't need you to bless me.
I don't need God to bless me.
I'm fine with my life as it is.
It's like I hired my mother.
"Manhattan has spas, where a woman can pay to feel good about herself."
I can't believe she opened your goodie drawer.
Everybody knows the night stand is private.
What do you have in there?
"What's in your goodie drawer, Robert's Rules Of Order ?"
I don't have a goodie drawer.
I don't need to know what's in it.
Nipple clamps will suffice for today.
"I'm not in the mood for steam, it's too hot."
"Then take off your towel, relax."
I don't feel like being relaxed in here.
There goes a woman who desperately needs a goodie drawer.
AndI'm just not comfortable being naked in public.
"This isn't really public, it's a ladies' locker room."
I didn't grow up in a naked house.
I bet she grew up in a naked house.
She might still live in a naked house.
"Sweetie, who cares how you look to other women."
"Charlotte, you have a beautiful figure."
Why was that women looking at me like my thighs were too big?
Samantha always felt good about herself.
"But after her minute massage, she felt even better."
I just had the most intense massage.
"Samantha's was good, but not that good."
"Samantha smiled, but a woman with a goodie closet doesn't need to pay for head."
"Then again, you can never have too many massages."
Samantha immediately got on the wait list for Kevin's next available appointment.
Miranda chose the next best thing.
"Magda was not only cleaning, she was performing an exorcism."
"Later that week, I had a religious experience at Manolo Blahnik."
"I'll have that incredibly rich looking, flourless chocolate thing"
Now you're making me feel bad.
This place has the best desserts.
The point of coming is to splurge.
Fruit has a lot of carbs.
Is there a new Zone book out?
The problem is not your thighs.
Hold on I need these for the WlTA luncheon.
"The heels are almost high enough to put me face to face with Natasha, if Natasha wears flats."
But why would she wear flats?
Do they make the right statement?
What statement do you want to make?
"I am beautiful, powerful and don't care you're only and married my ex."
I thought you didn't have a complex about your looks.
"It's a Natasha specific obsession, which will be over when she sees me, at the benefit, looking fabulous, in these shoes and a dress from Bergdorf's that'll cost a month's rent."
You don't have to prove anything.
"You are stunning, intelligent and funny."
"You could go to that luncheon, wearing that, and still be the most incredible woman in the room."
Why can't you do that for yourself?
"That afternoon, Charlotte faced her fear."
"Meanwhile, Samantha had spent the last half hour face down, picturing Kevin's face down on her."
"Since they were running out of time, she took the matter in her own hands."
What kind of person does such a thing?
To molest a trained professional while he is trying to do his job.
"Helena Rubinstein is a civilized place, for civilized people."
"I'm sorry, I can't allow you to come back here."
I have to protect my staff.
"I know that Kevin went down on another customer, and that's why I booked the appointment."
"The following Monday, Samantha and I were the definition of civilized."
We officially became ladies who luncheon.
"It was entrapment, false advertising and blatant discrimination."
You can't go down on one and not the other.
"I paid good money, expecting to be eaten out."
This is not the conversation I wish to have as my most amazing self.
No But I do see Wendy Wasserstein and Gloria Steinem.
"Hello Mimi, Ms Carrie Bradshaw, and Ms Samantha Jones."
"I'm a member, I just haven't been to an event, ever."
Last year we had an incident with Joyce Carol Oates.
"I'm not sure the Hello, my name is goes with the ensemble."
"She's got a cold, and didn't want to get everybody sick."
I can't believe that bitch is a no show.
Charged another outfit I can't afford.
"Maybe bounced a cheque to charity, just to prove I'm amazing."
I've paid we're having our drinks.
Who is this and what's she doing in my bedroom?
The thing you replaced with this lady.
No man will marry you if that is by your bed.
It says you don't need him.
What I don't need is another mother.
"I have one in Philadelphia, and that's close enough."
"I need a housekeeper, who will clean my apartment and stop judging because I'm a year old, single woman in New York."
"I drink coffee, have sex, buy pies and enjoy battery operated devices."
"If you can't deal with that, I will find a housekeeper who can."
I also head the committee to match mentors with underprivileged children.
It'd be wonderful if you'd be willing to work with kids who want to write.
Is that something they'd like to learn?
We can always use help in fundraising.
Jenna went to college with Natasha.
"Go ahead, tell her what you told me."
"OK, well, Natasha lived in my dorm, freshmen year at Tulane."
"Once, she showered with a guy in the community bathroom."
"And And she gained like ten pounds, sophomore year."
That's supposed to make me feel better?
Six years ago she had a weight problem?
You had to love her for trying.
"Samantha tried to make me feel good by making Natasha sound bad, but it only made me feel worse."
Another one and I'll lose my lunch.
When you get home you'll smile because she was a porker in college.
Ten pounds does not a porker make.
The woman who got Kevin fired.
Turns out I wasn't the kind of member those women in the arts needed.
"That night, in her spotless apartment, Miranda knew she'd been right to take a stand because of her night stand."
"Magda realized that single women in New York never make pies, but they sometimes make guys."
"A few weeks later, I got something in the mail from Women In The Arts."
"It was a Thank you for attending , signed by Natasha."
"I had to accept that in life, some women are simply better."
"No amount of shoes, or lack of pastry or making of pies will change that."
"I will never be the woman with the perfect hair, who can wear white and not spill on it."
"And chair committees, and write thank you notes."
And I can't feel bad about that.
But I could feel good about this.
"Miranda, it's good she got married."
It's been said that New Yorkers are the most jaded people in the world.
The fact is we've done and seen it all.
"So when Charlotte said that her new show at the gallery would blow us away, we took it with the proverbial grain of salt."
"It was the latest installation from photographer Baird Johnson, entitled Drag Kings The collision of illusion and reality ."
"Look at that bulge, it's shocking."
Hurry up and look before Giuliani shuts it down.
Women dressed as men are popular.
I thought it was Pokemon .
All it takes is stick on sideburns and a sock in your pants.
I've always had a thing for cowboys.
"Reminder, John Wayne is a Jane."
I dated a guy who liked to wear my underwear.
But I've never gone the other way.
If you're gay you can wear everyone's underwear.
Being a drag king would be fun.
"I have enough trouble trying to be a woman in a man's world, without being a woman pretending to be a man."
"If you change your mind, you've got cop written all over you."
What inspired you to do this?
I feel we have dual powers within each of us.
"Men can be very female, and women can be very male."
"You know, I'm gonna go and get a canape."
"Because, I'm starved, so Not that a canape is a meal."
I can never make the first move.
Sounds like someone needs a sock in the pants.
His generation has a different letter than ours.
"Later, Miranda found her apartment had undergone its own gender transformation."
I got a key from when I fed your cat.
I didn't think we were seeing each other tonight.
Planning on seeing the other boy?
Now you've ruined that This is what we're watching?
"Easy, you're making my brain hurt."
Don't you have to work tonight?
I've got stuff here I can change into.
Miranda loved the man inside of her.
She just didn't love him inside her apartment all the time.
"Come on, the ice waits for no woman."
I'm practicing my triple salchow in my head.
"I was dragged around by Sean, my generation something else date."
"We met at a party, celebrating a new lnternet magazine Sean was running that I still couldn't find on my computer."
It's easier to balance when you're not smoking.
Smoking is the only thing that keeps me balanced.
You have to give me credit for an original date.
It's not officially a date without cocktails.
My coach is gonna kill me.
"Half a flask later, Sean and I had broken the iceat least my ass had."
That last fall was at least a
Nothing about him or our third date felt typical.
When was your last serious relationship?
You wanna take another spin around the death rink?
I ended something a while ago.
Two years of a lot of back and forths.
I could have told you that.
The weird thing is he was so open.
"Like, Hi, I'm from Colorado ."
You're not allowed to be bisexual in Colorado.
What kind of question is that?
That generation is all about sexual experimentation.
All the kids are going bi.
"If they all jump off a bridge, you will too?"
When did the sexes get all confused?
"Somewhere between Gen X and Y, they blended and made XY."
I did the date the bisexual guy thing in college.
They all ended up with men.
Which is why there are no men left for us.
Maybe I do have a problem with this.
I'm not even sure bisexuality exists.
It's just a layover on the way to Gaytown.
Isn't that next to Ricky Martinville?
He's open to all sexual experiences.
"You're not marrying him, you're making out with him."
Pick a side and stay there.
I've got a date with my remote control.
That's three hours of alone time.
"That night, I couldn't get Samantha's words out of my head."
Was Sean's generation on to something?
Was sexual flipping the wave of the future?
"If it was, could I play that game or was I over the hill?"
"If women can transform into men, and men into women and we can sleep with everyone, then maybe gender doesn't exist anymore."
"If we can take the best of the other sex and make it our own, has the opposite sex become obsolete?"
"If you're a head hunter, get me a good assistant."
I'm here for the assistant job.
Samantha hired Matt five minutes later.
"She was the man of the office, but she could fit one more."
"Meanwhile downtown, Charlotte could have used some help herself."
I didn't hear you come in.
I thought I'd come by and scare the shit out of you.
Pick up my cheque for the pieces I sold.
I would love you to pose for me.
Every woman has a male inside.
I'm really bad at math and I can't change a tire to save my life.
I'll get it out of you.
"The next night, Sean and I went to a club so new, even I hadn't heard of it."
What's the name of this place?
Like the stuff on your head.
Ten seconds of kissing and I almost forgot his lack of sexual orientation.
"Who are you checking out, the guy or the girl?"
I was looking for the bathroom.
"Sorry, this whole bisexual thing is throwing me for a loop."
You've been with men and women ?
Were you just looking at that guy
I've been in three major relationships.
"An hour later, Sean was in my bed."
Tell me or I'll make you go skating again.
Do I kiss better than a guy?
"If there was this good looking guy walking towards you and across the street was a beautiful girl, which one ."
Could you stop making this all about sex?
The way your upper lip tastes.
"It may not have been all about sex, but it was for the next two hours."
I wasn't the only one with younger men on the brain.
We've called your boss three times already.
That is not how I do business.
Don't talk to them like that.
You want them to call you?
Let me remind you that I am the boss here.
I just think you deserve some respect.
"Samantha found Matt's boyish arrogance annoying, unprofessionaland incredibly hot."
Miranda was having a problem sharing a space with the other sex.
Tomorrow we'll buy some paint and draw a line down the middle.
You have to keep it neater.
Maybe if you can spare a drawer I can keep my things out of the way.
Actually I'd like to move in.
Most single women dream of this moment.
There is no need to go at warp speed.
I'm sure every book would say we're not ready.
I'll get out of your hair.
I just I need my space.
I feel like I'm being suffocated.
"Jesus, Miranda It's like you're the guy sometimes."
"Faced with relationship problems, some women turn to fried food."
Miranda turned to the latest fitness craze The Goddess Workout .
All you have to do is let her out.
This helps you to be a woman?
I must find my inner goddess.
Open yourself like a lotus flower.
"My hips don't pop, I'm a guy."
"This isn't helping me find my inner goddess, only my inner humiliation."
I'm never gonna be a girly girl.
I'll never be a lotus flower.
A girly girl would want her boyfriend to move in.
She also wears make up to the gym.
And makes little hearts above her i's .
I do love him I do.
In any relationship one person is the alpha dog.
You don't like sharing your water dish.
I'm very free with the chew toys.
Miranda arrived home later to an empty apartment.
"And for the first time, she really didn't like it."
"While Miranda and I worked out our inner goddesses, Baird was working the male out of Charlotte."
"I'm sorry, I can't do this."
You can get any woman you want.
You eat guys like me for lunch.
I think I need a bigger sock.
Who knows whether it was the sock or the suit or Baird.
"Charlotte wasn't just a chick with a dick, she was a chick with balls."
The two alpha dogs at Samantha's were not getting along as well.
These invitations need to go to the printers ASAP.
Drop them at d Street then pick up lunch.
"Fine, then I'll be an hour late."
Do you realize you're my assistant?
Your job is to do what I say.
Who do you think you are?
I don't know when she will.
You have a shitty attitude too.
"The bad news is, you're fired."
The good news is now I can fuck you.
The only place Samantha and Matt worked well together was in bed.
"That night, Miranda invited Steve for pasta."
"I was gonna make you dinner, and then this conference call went over two hours."
I needed extra virgin olive oil.
So I got the stuff in a jar.
"We'll order pizza, it's no big deal."
I just spilled Marinara sauce and you saw that.
But I've never lived with anybody before.
I don't do laundry sometimes for two weeks.
"I don't know if I can move forward, but I don't want to lose you."
I guess I really am a woman.
"A week later, Miranda's man moved into her place."
The same day that Charlotte moved her man into her place.
She was too embarrassed at how forward she'd been.
She might have been that type of guy but never that type of woman.
Sean and I were almost at the party.
"If there's no vodka, it's your head."
"Take it easy, dude, we're here."
I was attending a party of my boyfriend's ex boyfriend.
"Carrie, this is Mark and his boyfriend Garth."
"Two L's , no E ."
They just got married in Hawaii.
It was a spur of the moment.
I didn't want another big wedding.
"We were high for most of it, otherwise it would've been miserable."
Don't forget I gave you that egg.
"This is our straight friend, Joel."
"An hour later, I had almost got it straight."
And Brett used to live with Joel?
This party was a platter of sexual orientation.
I was in Alice ln Confused Sexuality Land.
"I could stand up, walk out and prove I was an old fart."
Or I could fall down the rabbit hole.
That was the last night I saw Sean.
"They could do what they wanted, but I was too old to play this game."
"So I took my hot, old fart ass home"
"One reason why people still risk the possible horror of a first date, is the possible magic of the good night kiss at the front door."
The world slows down for a second as some people take that hopeful lean into a possible future together.
How do you think I felt?
Did he wanna fuck you or floss you?
I thought he'd be a good kisser.
Until their pointy tongue darts in and out.
"Pointy tongue, the worst of the worst."
The worst is when they expect you to do the work.
Their tongue lays in your mouth Iike a clam.
"I'd say, Get it out, put it in a cab and take its lazy ass home."
You'd dump a guy for a bad kiss?
"If their tongue just lays there, what is their dick gonna do?"
Maybe we can work on it.
A bad kisser is a non negotiable.
I'm not dumping Brad because of that.
Then change his name from Brad to Bad.
Until his tongue was in your stomach?
Can you ladies hold it down?
Adeena Williams was my newspaper's former food editor.
"And the chef and owner of Fusion, whose specialty was a mingling of trendy food with soul food."
Martha Stewart meets Puff Daddy on a plate.
"This time next year, okra will be so fashionable."
"This is my brother, who brings me tons of music industry business."
"I gotta go, but I'm sending dessert."
Didn't we meet at the Columbia Records party for Jennifer Lopez?
I'm sure I'd have remembered you.
"Chivon Williams, I used to rep for Tommy Boy Records."
I remember from the guest list.
"Samantha Jones, if you need me for a party."
Gotta love a fella who loves jewellery.
That is one fine looking man.
"First of all, it isn't black talk."
You shouldn't be talking like that.
Samantha is rude and politically incorrect.
"The next day I had just settled down with a cup of fresh coffee and a coffee table full of fashion magazines, when Who is it?"
Have you seen The New York Times style section?
I can't handle hard news before noon.
"There's a beautiful man downtown, selling furniture."
I got a whole afternoon planned with Australian Vogue .
I'm not gonna drop everything to go to see some cute guy.
People with nothing better to do than ogle some craftsman.
"If you see anything you like, say you're a designer."
I got off my end table.
"He was warm, masculine and classic American."
I'll visit you and the kids at your cabin up state.
"He was warm, stylish and classic gay."
I'll come visit you in your cabin up state.
You should get him a chewtoy.
"To his credit, he picks the best looking ladies."
You can't imagine howflattered I am.
I shouldn't let him run loose in the store.
"When I heard the lie come out of my mouth, I knew I was interested."
"You say that about every piece, right?"
This leather is about years old.
I stripped it off an old railroad car seat.
I wasn't really in the market for a leather chair.
But I had to have whatever it was I just felt.
With the designer discount and dog humiliation factor How's that?
How soon can it be delivered?
"In New York City retail lingo, that meant l like you too ."
Where do you want it delivered and can I take you out for dinner?
"The dog humping aside, it was one of those perfect New York Saturdays."
"At Miranda's, Steve was having an even better Saturday."
"You know at the Knicks game, somebody makes a half court shot for a million dollars?"
They picked my name from the contest I entered at Sam Goodies.
But don't get your hopes up.
"It's a tough shot, isn't it?"
"For other guys, but they don't have my moves."
The problem is you don't know how good I am.
Don't let these legs fool you.
"Next week, come to the playground and watch me shoot."
You haven't had a crush in a while.
"Big wasn't a crush, he was a crash."
And I believe him to be very cute.
"So cute, I bought a chair I couldn't afford just because he made it."
So the chair is a write off.
I haven't had a crush since Sean Cassidy.
At this age I'd have to say I'm crush proof.
Steve thinks he's gonna win a million dollars.
I have to repeat it until I believe it.
It's totally illogical and he wants me to be supportive.
There are Knicks who can't make it.
"I would support a real dream, like opening his own bar."
"Isn't that what you couples do, support each other's silly dreams?"
"That week, Chivon invited Samantha to go uptown and hear an artist he was thinking of signing."
"Although Samantha had been in the club scene for years, she'd never been asked to spread without being offered a cocktail."
"In a matter of minutes, Samantha felt at home in Chivon's world."
"In a matter of hours, Chivon was at home in Samantha's home."
I thought all rap had a harder edge.
"They can be hard or soft, like you."
You have so much attitude up front.
Who do you think you're fooling?
I don't usually sleep with men who have nicer accessories than me.
Where did you get these fabulous earrings?
I hope you can sleep in a little.
"Samantha rarely asked a man to stay over, but she couldn't resist having breakfast with his Tiffanies"
"One reason some people still risk the possible horror of a first date, is the possible magic of the good night kiss at the front door."
My dog is obsessed with you.
He kept me up talking all night.
"I had to say, Pete, let her go."
I have a confession to make I'm not a designer.
"But don't worry, I only lie about furniture, nothing else."
"When the lie came out of my mouth, I realised how much I liked him."
"If it bothers you, I'll just"
"I'm sorry, I have an Altoid."
"I don't wanna be a jerk, but I can't date a smoker."
I couldn't believe what my crush was saying.
"Later that night, I wondered When did dating become so dump friendly?"
What happened to the time when a bad kiss or a cigarette or a ridiculous dream was part of a person's portfolio?
"In today's dating market, is it wise to liquidate certain stocks, the first sign they might not perform as well as expected?"
Or are there things one should try and negotiate?
"In relationships, what are the deal breakers ?"
I think it's really sexy when you lightly touch your lips to mine.
"Never one to trade a stock before it had matured, a determined and patient Charlotte tried to teach Bad how to kiss good."
And I like it when you slowly open your mouth and just tickle my lips with the tip of your tongue.
"With just a little negotiating, Brad's stock suddenly began to rise."
And my mouth is up here.
"Downtown at Marty Mendleson's, others were experiencing a much more successful first kiss."
Let's move it to the bedroom.
I've been collecting them for years.
"And thisis Mary, Queen of Scots."
"No, the Southern Belle sits on the table."
Was Stanford enough of a queen to sleep with one who collected queens?
"Uptown at Fusion, Samantha felt a bit like a queen herself."
Did I tell you how beautiful you look tonight?
Genius' over tired ass is dragging all over this restaurant.
"Aunt Alice and her friends are leaving, if you want to pay your respects."
Aunt Alice is out of the door already.
You go and I'll talk with Samantha.
"Chivon is right, you are a genius."
What's going on between you and Chivon?
You've been in here three times.
"Not that's any of your business, but no, we're not just fucking."
We actually really like each other.
I don't want you seeing my brother.
"I'm sure you're a nice person, but you're white."
I have a problem with my brother getting serious with a white woman.
"To Adeena, Samantha's skin was a non negotiable."
I'm never going to approve and my approval means a lot to my brother.
Just save us the time and trouble and get out before anybody gets hurt.
I'll send over some Mississippi mud pie.
The only place Adeena was interested in fusion was on a plate.
She can't dis me just cos I'm white.
Please tell me you didn't say dis.
Maybe you should stop seeing him.
There is no reason to bring race into this.
He happens to have the biggest
We know he has a big black cock.
I was about to say the biggest heart.
"But, yes, he does have a big black cock."
"To Charlotte, a black and blue chin was a deal breaker."
I'm not backing down to her.
She shouldn't sacrifice who she is because somebody has a problem.
Too bad Aidan had a problem with it.
But you have to accept people for who they are.
You choose cigarettes over a guy?
"You bought furniture, he was so cute."
For him to dump me over a little thing like smoking.
Smoking is not a little thing.
It's dirty and you're killing yourself.
We put up with it cos we love you.
You have a reason to quit.
I don't like being ganged up on.
Smoking is a part of who I am.
"I'll quit when I want to, not cos a cute guy told me to."
Fighting for Chivon is one thing.
Holding on to cigarettes is just wack.
Tell me she didn't say wack .
It's not like you have a hideous doll collection.
You think that's an overreaction to a repressed childhood?
I could overlook his receding hair.
"Well, Stannie, if I may call you that."
When was the last time someone you had a crush on asked you out?
"You're no one to talk, Miss Marlboro Lights."
I am no one to talk.
"Maybe I could quit, just a little."
I can't see myself getting excited because my boyfriend's three foot Lady Di doll is arriving from QVC.
I got behind on this file.
This has to be ready Monday.
I don't have time to watch you shoot hoops.
I ask you to do one thing for me and you can't.
You know how many times I do what you want?
Why are you getting so upset?
"If this is ever gonna work, I need you to believe in us."
"I need you to believe in me, even if you think it's fucking stupid."
This is for the big money
Steve never did win the big money at Madison Square Garden.
"But having Miranda show up, made him feel like a million bucks."
He was just starting to get over you.
"Since you negotiated such a good price for me on the chair, maybe I can negotiate a little deal for you on the smoking."
I've been thinking about quitting anyway.
Maybe you think I'm more of a smoker than I am.
I only have like a cigarette with cocktails.
Do you wanna get some coffee?
"The second he said coffee, I knew I wanted a cigarette."
"It was one of those dates when you have so much to say that coffee turns into a movie, a movie into a long walk and a long walk turns into the beginning of cold turkey rehab."
Would you like to eat some dinner?
I was completely ready to trade in my crush
when it dawned on me how much I was willing to give up for a cigarette.
"Meanwhile, back in the Valley of the Dolls , Stanford thought there was something more rare than a porcelain face his passion."
"To Marty Mendleson, a broken face was a deal breaker."
Samantha was about to come face to face with her deal breaker.
I don't want you dating my brother.
"Get to know me, then hate me."
This is my brother we're talking about.
For a woman with such a progressive view of world food
I'll say it to you plain.
"I don't care how many Jennifer Lopez dresses you have hanging in your closet, you don't belong in here."
You'll never understand what I'm talking about.
Please go and leave my brother alone.
"As Samantha turned to leave, she realised this wasn't a black thing."
She'd never backed down to a bitch and she wasn't about to start.
"No woman, no matter what color, has the right to tell me who I fuck."
Get your little white pussy away from my brother
"Get your big, black ass out of my face"
And your okra wasn't all that
I'm trying to keep it real.
"Seven hours into the world's longest date, all I could think was, Five more minutes and I can smoke the cigarette hidden in my purse."
Would you like a dessert menu?
"I forgot, I have a deadline."
Carrie We've got a little problem.
Adeena has always been there for me.
"Ever since Mom died, it's only been the two of us."
"Adeena has her issues, but you didn't have to insult her food."
You mean the world to me.
Samantha knewthe real problem wasn't her white pussy.
It was that Chivon was a black pussy who wouldn't stand up to his sister.
"And for Samantha Jones, that was the deal breaker."
It was too bad we had to end.
"But that's the way it goes, I guess."
We had some good times together and I'm sure we could have had more.
"In the end, I really did it for me."
I just hope he's worth it
You can count on one hand the things a New Yorker will wait for.
"My list includes: the perfect apartment, the chocolate souffle at Le Bernardin, and the annual Manolo Blahnik sale."
"After four dates with the furniture designer, whose kiss made my knees weak, this New Yorker had waited long enough."
"So, do you wanna sleep over?"
I have to get up early in the morning.
"Apparently, that New Yorker had not."
"When one door closes, another one opens."
"At m, the door that opened was Samantha's."
Freda in was held up at gunpoint.
We have the suspect on tape.
This is supposed to be a safe building.
The guy came in behind the guy who came in Samantha.
Who has a guest at m?
What did everybody do last night?
I don't want to talk about it.
Did you sleep with someone on the second date?
"Alexander Lemly, the investment banker I met at an art show."
I don't think I can say it.
"He didn't say it at the drycleaners, but when he was in you."
Do you think I'm a whore?
"If you're a whore, what does that make me?"
Do you think I'm a whore?
You have had a lot of bone in you.
Nobody wants to marry a whore.
Even Charlotte is having more sex than me.
We're spending a lot of time together.
But he doesn't wanna sleep with me.
Maybe his dick curves to the right.
"Wait too long to sleep with someone, you become just friends."
"As supposed to his fucking bitch, his fucking whore."
"If Samantha was right, I had little time left before the relationship window closed."
So I wore my little dress that left little to the imagination.
Do you want to take this inside?
Do you just wanna be friends?
Is that how you kiss your friends?
Why don't you wanna sleep with me?
Whatever it is I'd rather know sooner than later.
I do wanna sleep with you.
I've been down that road before.
I've slept with women quickly and I'm still single.
"My new thing is, I want to try and sleep with somebody I care about."
I really think that I can care about you.
It's only been a week and a half.
Why did I expect to sleep with him after only a week and a half?
Had I become so jaded that I didn't recognize romance when it kissed me on the lips?
Modern women need a cheat sheet to remind us romance isn't dead.
"I tell you, it didn't even occur to me, which is so depressing."
Is that what years of dating in Manhattan does to a woman?
I'll tell you what it does.
"My tests, which she threw in for good measure, were positive."
"There aren't any symptoms, but it can cause infertility."
I guess it's good I caught it.
"I mean Not that I caught it, but that I found out."
"It could be any number of guys, which is what I told my gynecologist."
"She told me to contact all the people that I might have given it to, so they can all be treated."
I knew what was bothering her.
The same thought had bothered me since the guy I'd been seeing for days asked me to slow down.
"If you're a something woman in Manhattan and you're sexually active, it's inevitable that you'll rack up a certain number of partners."
But how many is too many men?
Are we simply romantically challenged or are we sluts?
It was the question on Charlotte's mind.
"Sorry, my mind is somewhere else."
"I hate putting people out of work, but it happens after a merger."
Maybe I should teach ESL on the side.
Actuallywhat you said the other night kind of bothered me.
You knowwhen we were in bed and you You yelled out something.
I remember it being very nice.
I'm sure it was in the heat of the moment.
Do you want to try my swordfish?
"By dessert, Charlotte had decided to forget it and call it a do over."
"You fucking bitch, you fucking whore."
That's a horrible thing to say.
I just get lost in the moment.
I don't think that about you.
"Believe me, you are sweet, smart and lovely."
You are the kind of woman I hope to marry some day.
I promise never to say that again.
"As Charlotte started to feel better, Miranda started to feel worse."
Maybe you'll change your mind when I'm down around your elbows.
"I can't tonight, I have chlamydia."
"I don't even knowwhat that is, but it sounds like a problem."
It's just a sexually transmitted disease.
I might have given it to you or you to me.
"Either way, you should get tested."
"What's gonna happen, does it hurt when you pee?"
"Men are just Carriers, there aren't any symptoms at all."
Then why do I need to know?
If you don't get treated you can pass it on to other people.
"You are my only other person, and you already have it."
"Yeah, but if you've got it, we'll keep passing it back and forth."
I'd rather not sleep with you until it's out of my body.
I've got six more days of antibiotics.
Will you please just take care of it?
Steve's trip to the doctor didn't cure his fear of doctors.
I'm here because my girlfriend said to get the test.
I need a sample from the inside of your penis.
"As Steve faced something every man dreads, Miranda faced something every woman dreads."
She was making a list of all the men she'd slept with.
At least all the ones she could remember.
She wondered how she did all these men and did her law degree and became a successful lawyer.
Samantha knew her number was up there.
But she didn't know everybody else knew.
We know it was you who buzzed in the gunman.
Every time I'm in this elevator you're with a different man.
"The next day, Miranda's sex life was flashing before her as well."
"Nowyou're married, you don't have to worry about stuff like this."
"Miss Hobbes, line two is still holding."
"Hi, it's David, returning a call."
You call me after months to discuss my health?
Perhaps you gave it to me.
"What are you gonna do, sue me?"
You told me never to call you.
"Meanwhile, I was still waiting for the diagnosis on my relationship."
Would Aidan become friend or boyfriend?
He certainly kissed like a boyfriend.
Don't you have two matching plates?
"What do you use for wine, promotional coffee mugs?"
But he teased me like a friend.
I don't care what anybody says.
I think Catherine Zeta Jones is hot.
"Not as hot as you, but she's hot."
I think we're just friends who kiss occasionally.
He's been in the bathroom for half an hour.
All we did was eat Chinese and watch Zorro .
Now I'm working and he's reading the paper on the john.
"This isn't romance, this is bullshit."
"I have to go, my friend wants to see me in the bathroom."
"What did you want, because Wow."
It's like a Danielle Steele novel in here.
"From a writer, I'm pretty sure that's an insult."
I thought a bath would help you relax.
Are you sure this isn't just a cheap ploy to see me naked?
"This is about you, so enjoy."
But that doesn't make us friends cos I'll be thinking about you naked.
"Fuck it, let's just do it."
This isn't how it should happen.
You said this was just a bath.
"The next night, Samantha was feeling exposed."
"If you wanna say something about me, say it to my face."
There are always men in the hall.
I got robbed because of you.
I can't close my left eye.
They practically chased me like I was Fuckenstein.
They can't evict you for having sex.
"They're jealous, dried up old farts who haven't had sex since Eisenhower."
I remind them of what they can't have.
It might be time to move.
You have a rent controlled apartment on the Upper East Side.
"This isn't rent control, it's life control."
"I have to go, I have a date with Aidan."
Don't tell me you're not having sex yet.
"Tonight, we're going to a blues club."
"By the way, I got a little preview."
"I assure you, there is no curving in any direction."
"That night, Charlotte had a date as well."
"And he was doing his best to be the strong, silent type."
"You fucking bitch, you fucking whore"
"I hate myself, what's wrong with me?"
"That night, Alexander decided to stop seeing Charlotte and start seeing a therapist."
And Steve got his test back.
"It was negative, like the rest of the experience."
That doctor with the swab Ouch
I don't even want to swab my ears.
I'm the one with the disease.
"I'm a big, dirty, diseased whore."
That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
I had to make a list of all the guys I've slept with and it's not short.
"It's No, I can't tell you"
I've never told anybody my number.
I spent a day at the free clinic.
I've had enough embarrassment for one week.
I'm a bartender and I'm cute.
"Note, men who have had a lot of sexual partners are not called sluts."
They are called very good kissers.
A few are even called romantics.
I can't believe you've never been to the Blue Note.
I've never done a lot of things.
I can think of one thing in particular.
I can think of one other thing.
What do you think about me staying the night?
I arranged for the super's kid to walk Pete and feed him.
"For the first time in a long time, I was nervous."
We were going to sleep together and it was going to mean something.
"I was no virgin, but this was definitely virgin territory."
"The nice thing about a new relationship, it's a clean slate."
"And speaking of clean slates, Samantha moved to the trendy Meatpacking District."
"Whores were whores, men were women and rents higher."
Aidan and I had been seeing each other for three weeks when
The truth was I really didn't.
"The next day I searched for unpaid bills, unanswered calls, unmet deadlines."
But I hadn't so much as missed a teeth cleaning.
My life appeared to be in order.
"But the next night, like clockwork I realized I was in an existential crisis."
One that not even the sight of this season's Dolce Gabbana sandals could lift me out of.
Do you wanna spend the night?
"What was wrong was, for the first time in my life, I was in a relationship where absolutely nothing was wrong."
"Nothing but calm seas, blue horizons."
You're not getting the stomach flip.
Which is just a fear of losing the guy.
Maybe I'm not used to being with someone who doesn't do the seductive withholding dance.
But there is an upside to being with a guy with no surprises.
"Steve is completely predictable, but that's what I love about him."
Are you dating a man or a mini van?
My new favorite thing to do on a Saturday night is Steve's laundry and I've never been happier.
Your relationship is my greatest fear realized.
"I understand your dilemma and from my experience, if he seems too good to be true, he probably is."
Nowwe're dumping guys for being too available.
This is all solid proof of what I've read in this great new book.
"It says if you really wanna get married, you shouldn't spend so much time around dysfunctional single women."
Marriage lncorporated: Howto apply successful business strategies to finding a husband .
Chapter one: How To Get Ahead By Giving Head .
It encourages professional women to approach finding a mate with the dedication and organization they bring to their careers.
I'm more a student of chaos theory.
"If you don't see as much of me, I'm with my married friends."
And howwill this help you meet your mate?
Bachelor friends of married men are the city's greatest untapped resource.
The way to meet them is through the husbands.
So my first assignment is to befriend the husbands.
"That evening, as Charlotte began her new career as a husband hunter, Miranda returned home to feather her stress free love nest."
I heated up some leftover lasagne.
An hour later it was on to dessert.
Followed by exactly eight minutes of no frills sex.
And minutes of Front Line .
Theirs was the kind of closeness that only came from true intimacy.
Samantha was experiencing intimacy that only came from anonymity.
"An ear, nose and throat man that Samantha met actually we're not sure where."
Suffice to say it happened quickly.
"Will you get me some water, please?"
I want to take a hit of Viagra.
Number one that's very presumptuous of you.
"And number two from what I can tell, you don't need any help in that area whatsoever."
What does it do for you?
Sends me on a rocket trip right through your solar system.
I'll be right back with that water.
While Samantha enjoyed the thrill of the new and Miranda's relationship happily floated on a placid sea I was searching for hidden icebergs.
I hate it when guys act all cute.
You should know I get a tad bitchy from time to time.
I'm sure you have your bad traits.
"It's all gonna come out eventually, so I'd like to know now and that way I can decide if I'd like to deal with it or not."
This is the strangest two blocks I ever walked.
"Again I'm sorry, but this relationship cannot just sail on like it is: perfect."
"Frankly, I can't take the pressure."
What the hell is wrong with you that you're not married?
Can't you relax and go with the flow.
How long you think this phase is gonna last?
My folks are coming this weekend and I want you to meet them.
"So, these parents that are coming to town do they know what's wrong with you?"
"The next evening, taking a page from Marriage lncorporated , Charlotte had dinner with her married friends, Amy and Dennis."
Allow me to get right to the point.
"After careful consideration, I've decided that I'm getting married."
That's where you two come in.
"Dennis, name one great single friend that you have to fix me up with."
If he can tear himself away from his internet company to go on a date.
He is so nice and cute.
I'll call you tomorrowto follow up.
I have tickets to the opera on Saturday night.
I would like to take Phil.
"The next morning before work, while sorting Steve's laundry, Miranda came face to face with the true meaning of intimacy."
There is a point where a couple can get too comfortable.
I reached it this morning washing Steve's underwear.
I'm living with skid marks guy.
Why do men get skid marks?
Or are they just in a rush?
I don't know but it goes hand in hand with urinating on the seat.
"When your boyfriend is so comfortable he can't be bothered to wipe his ass, that's the end of romance."
It's certainly the end of laundry night.
Maybe I mistake falling into a rut with intimacy.
How often are you having sex?
We've got every move down pat.
It's more like a race to have an orgasm.
"It's nice to be a contestant, isn't it?"
"We whine when we don't have a boyfriend, we whine when we do."
Do you remember how Big kept me away from his mother?
And how pissed it used to make me?
"Now, Aidan's offering both his parents on a silver platter and I'm not sure I want to meet them."
I've never met Steve's mother and I'm in no rush.
The irony is Aidan's acting exactly how I wish Big would have behaved.
And I'm behaving just like Big.
Maybe you don't believe it's for real unless somebody plays hard to get.
"When things come too easy, we're suspect."
Do they have to get complicated before we believe they're for real?
We're raised to believe that true love never runs smoothly.
There always have to be obstacles in Act Two before you can live happily ever after in Act Three.
But what happens when the obstacles aren't there?
Does that mean there's something missing?
Do we need drama to make a relationship work?
"A few days later, still hearing no word from Dennis about her date Charlotte made a call to his office."
He can reach me at home or at work and it's very important because I have tickets to the opera on Saturday.
"Never mind, just have him call me."
"Her call unanswered, Charlotte followed up persistently."
Can you tell Dennis that Charlotte Yorke called?
"It's regarding my future husband, Phil."
You've reached the office of Dennis Fincher.
I'm either out of the office or away from my desk.
Please leave a message at the sound of the tone.
"Obviously, you have some good reason for keeping Phil and I apart."
I can't imagine what it is but this is Phil's loss and not mine and don't bother returning this call either.
While Charlotte was a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown my anxiety free relationship was driving me crazy.
I'm gonna have to pass on dinner.
My parents get in tomorrow night.
But I thought you'd meet us for breakfast the next day.
I've been thinking about this meeting your parents.
I just wondered if it's a good idea.
"No, I'm not worried about that."
Well What if they love me and if we break up you'll always have to explain to them what happened to the adorable girl.
Are you breaking up with me?
"Where I come from, meeting the parents Oh, so big"
You'll meet them some other time.
"So, I guess we won't be seeing each other this weekend."
Maybe we should see each other less then we can miss each other more.
"You're so available to me, and I'm so available to you."
I'm just making room for you.
You always say the right things.
I'm sabotaging the best relationship I've ever had.
It's better to have a man waiting for you than the other way around.
"And if you hadn't been available, I'd be here alone, just some pathetic dateless freak."
So glad it worked out for you.
I'm not taking this lying down.
"Well, here I am at the opera which I planned on going to with Phil, who I guess you've decided I'm not good enough for."
I just got back from a business trip.
My secretary gave me all your messages.
I had no idea you wanted to meet Phil so badly.
Why don't I set something up tomorrow evening?
I created all that drama in my head for nothing.
I guess I'm in for another wild ride.
What would happen if I tried one of these?
I don't think they've established that it works for women.
"There's no harm in trying is there, doctor?"
Samantha officially became the first woman to land on the moon.
Even more so with a man.
"Well, I did expect to be taking Phil."
It's quite a lovely evening you planned for a man you've never even met.
"You knowwhat, honey, I'm not feeling well."
Do you want me to come with you?
"I knew it was rude and over dramatic, but I felt like I'd just seen the phantom of the opera."
"Yes, ditching Charlotte was slightly hysterical, but the idea of sitting across from Big and Natasha through the second act of Aida was too emotional to bear."
This time I knew what was wrong.
The shock of seeing Big again not only made my stomach flip it sent my spleen leaping right into my throat.
I saw Big tonight at the opera.
I think she's swearing off women forever.
I'm realizing that maybe there is something to this available man thing.
Now I know I wanna be with a man who wants to be with me.
I've had enough relationship drama for one lifetime.
Shouldn't you be telling this to Aidan?
I'll wait until a more civilized hour.
The next morning I waited until a decent hour to call Aidan and tell him how much I missed him.
"Hi, it's Carrie calling for Aidan."
When I hadn't heard from him by that evening I began to get butterflies in my stomach.
"Hey, I'm not in but Pete is."
The girl you wanted to introduce to your parents.
I'm just calling to say hey.
I was getting a dreaded feeling that I had played this all wrong.
"Suddenly, the idea of losing Aidan left me short of breath."
"Meanwhile, Miranda was trying not to breathe near Steve's shorts."
I thought you might need some help with the wash.
But there's nothing like a twist in the third act to spice up even the most banal scenario.
"And while Miranda and Steve found new life in the familiar, Charlotte was blindly feeling her way through the unfamiliar."
You couldn't trust me alone with Phil?
"Charlotte, Phil's not coming I never called Phil."
I didn't want you to meet him.
You'd like him and that could be a problem.
"I'm in love with you, Charlotte."
You can't be in love with me you're married to my friend.
"Things haven't been great with us, and I can't stop thinking about you."
You kept your single friends away from me so you could cheat?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I'm not interested in starting some married man's car.
"And that's how, in the most dramatic fashion, Charlotte met her new leading man."
"Well, time to pop one of those baby blues."
Let's go au naturel this time.
Don't you think it's good without it?
Let's save it for those special times.
Mark realized he had brought too much intensity to their relationship.
He wrote Samantha a prescription and she promised never to call him again.
"After two days of not hearing from Aidan, I realized only a dramatic gesture could salvage things."
"You asked me to be here, and I wasn't sure if I could."
"Honestly I mean, meeting the parents is so Then I realized I wanna meet them but I didn't know if you still wanted me to."
"I've called and you haven't called me, so then I thought I'm just gonna go, because being in a relationship means taking a riska leap of faith."
No matter how many times one might have been disappointed before.
I said to myself I'm just gonna show upbecause you're a good man.
Why haven't you called me back?
I was just trying to be less available.
You don't have to do everything I say.
Can I introduce you to my parents?.
They'll just have to get used to that.
"I realized then, that I had made my stomach flip all on my own."
Manhattan is a place you can get anything anytime.
But you can't get your dry cleaning.
"Charlotte was spending her time with Trey, a doctor from family money who had it all."
Apparently Trey was one New Yorker not getting everything anytime.
I wasn't feeling well last night so he took me for some soup on h street and then we went to d.
Then did your physics homework with you?
"No, I wanna take it slow."
You've only known him for two weeks.
"You can know his e mail address, but not that he's the one."
"And it's really hard, because he's very sexy."
But I don't want to ruin it by having sex too early.
"Oh, so you're everything but girl."
I like to think of it as kissing with extras.
I read that if you don't have sex for a year you can be revirginized.
You can erase your sexual past and start again.
It was bad enough the first time.
"Half a joint, three thrusts, finito."
"And ps, it was on the ping pong table."
"Meanwhile, I was doing everything plus with Aidan."
I couldn't get out of bed with him.
"My bed was our restaurant, our entertainment, our little New York."
When will they send a search party for us?
"That's an awful long time, my friend."
Downtown another New Yorker was enjoying her full life.
Samantha had a new apartment in the ultra chic Meatpacking District and a new admirer.
"Listen, I would love to have you come up to my place tonight."
I make a mean wine spritzer.
Samantha said sorry but what she really meant was Since when is it acceptable for over the hill losers to ask out hot women like her?
I'm keeping you on neighborhood watch.
And just when Samantha thought her day couldn't get any worse
This is a catalogue for pre menopausal women.
Why don't they call it what it is?
J.Crew for women who are drying up.
You're on the wrong mailing list.
I shouldn't have signed up for that Mirabella trial subscription.
I bought a back pillow on line and ended up with catalogues for trusses.
Maybe I could interest you in vaginal lubrication suppositories?
"Listen: Ten years before menopause you may have symptoms including: all month long PMS, fluid retention, insomnia, depression, hot flushes or irregular periods."
But people give up their seats for you on the bus.
My vagina waits for no man.
You have to tighten and release it for ten minutes a day.
Kegel exercises I'm doing mine right now.
"Well, I can't wait for menopause."
It will be freeing not to have periods.
I can't wait till flow stops coming to town.
"My God, I have my period too."
I'll get mine in a few days.
"If Samantha was running late, I was running even later."
The Gab Magazine party was in an hour and my dress was at the cleaners.
Apparently my fabulous party dress would be staying in for the evening.
"Miranda and Steve decided instead of staying in, they'd go out."
Since when did it become appropriate to bring babies to restaurants?
God invented baby sitters for a reason.
I don't think it's so bad.
It's nice to have babies around.
"I love babies, but not with my soup."
"We'd have a cute baby, not one that looks like Khrushchev."
We wouldn't have to get married.
We've only been living together for two months.
It's not like owning a foosball table.
Do you know how much work it is?
But I can hang out with him during the day.
"Watch Sesame Street while you're at work, then I go to work at the bar."
"And I'd be up all night with the baby, alone and getting no sleep, then have to get up the next day and work hours to make partner so I can afford the apartment you're watching Sesame Street in."
Let's hope the baby inherits my positive attitude.
Can we please talk about something else?
While Miranda was left contemplating diapers I was contemplating McQueen versus Gucci.
It's your last chance to attend a fabulous party with a fabulous girl.
It's a party on a boat?
"And ps, the fabulous girl is rumored to be easy."
"No, I want the celebrity sightings."
I'd be stuck on this boat with all these celebs.
"It's tempting, but is it OK if I stay on dry land?"
Will you still be easy later?
The Gab party was everything they promised and more.
"Regis Philbin, Madonna and New Yorker ex editors were there."
"Unfortunately, Trey was doing most of the gabbing."
The part about the birthday present.
My mother gives me this awful machine for sorting change
He has a lot of change.
I lied to her and said I loved it.
I jumped into a cab and drove that thing right back.
I hear a woman yell like a hyena.
I almost hit my head on that plastic partition.
He told him to stop the meter.
"And there was Charlotte, lying on the street."
"Oh, and the cabbie got mad."
If my mother didn't give me bad gifts this wonderful gift would never have come into my life.
I'd heard the story at least three times.
Another minute of Trey and we would be in a man overboard situation.
"Hey, I'm gonna go to hit the buffet."
"As I walked away, I realised I hadn't seen Charlotte that happy in years and with a man she had known for five minutes."
And just when I thought I was safe
I ran into the man I'd been happy with for five minutes.
I thought I might see you here.
"Well, I gotta Dominick Dunne is holding my place in the bathroom line."
"Big and l, trapped together on a boat without dates."
Children and women with emotional baggage first.
He said the last fewweeks have been special.
It's about time I met you.
I better get back to Trey.
"I think this is it, Carrie."
One woman's Titanic is another woman's Love Boat .
So what was that back there?
Around Brooklyn there's gonna be a mutiny.
I didn't wanna subject him to the slimy media leeches.
"If you like this, you'll love the one being held hostage on h and Lex."
"The next morning I recovered from my see Big sickness, while downtown, Samantha realised maybe her ship had sailed."
Later we did brunch and bathroom at Time Cafe.
You're not in love with him.
You're in love with the expensive watch he gave you.
But they won't fit in my Kate Spade purse.
"Wow, Kate must have a tiny vagina."
The watch is a sign that he's in love with me too.
He's just in blue ball hell.
"When they're available, their light goes on."
"They wake up one day, decide to settle down, and turn their light on."
The next woman they pick up is the one they'll marry.
I can't believe that love is random.
You gotta get them when their light's on.
Men I meet are flashing yellows.
They can drive around for years and not be available.
They shouldn't be allowed to get behind the wheel
Most men don't stay lit long before they take the plunge versus most women who have been lit pretty much since birth.
"No, I don't have a tampon and probably will never need one again."
I haven't had my period in days.
For someone with no period you've got a mean case of PMS.
You have years of miserable cramps ahead of you.
Ladies What I'm about to tell you may come as a shock.
I'm a little older than you.
That night I couldn't stop thinking about time.
Was every second of our lives controlled by fate?
Or is life a series of random occurrences?
"If I wasn't always ten minutes late, would my life be totally different?"
Would I never run into Big?
Would there ever be a good time to see him?
You're gonna have to get used to the noise with a baby around.
I've been thinking about this baby thing.
We're not in a great place right now.
Can we have this conversation without Scooby Doo ?
It's the one where they find the ghost in the salt mine.
Then Miranda realised she may have already had a baby in her house.
I wanna shelve this baby thing for a while.
Put a coaster under that glass and turn off the lights before you come to bed.
We haven't had sex in over a week and he wants a baby.
You can always go the lmmaculate Conception route.
"Seriously, we're in this shitty place."
We fight and I'm working long hours for this partner thing.
And he's using a baby as a Band Aid for everything that's wrong with us.
What is wrong with you guys?
It's like he's a kid and I end up nagging him all the time.
I'm mean mommy and no one wants to fuck mean mommy.
Maybe I'm sabotaging the relationship so I don't have to actually be happy.
This baby is gonna need a lot of therapy.
But I do want one eventually and my clock is running out.
I've only got a million viable eggs left.
She had lost her spirit and no pill in the catalogue could correct that.
And so she accepted a date with Len.
"After all, day old bread needed to stick together."
Ever been in a Cadillac Eldorado?
There's even a button to adjust your lumbar.
Did I tell you I have an artificial hip?
Samantha couldn't listen to one more minute of Len
So she slept with him and his hip to shut him up.
"Baby, either you're a virgin or flow just came to town."
These sheets are two grand a set.
What she really meant was there are more young studs in this pre pre menopausal woman's future.
"The next day, Miranda was putting in time and a half at her firm when"
"Meet me in half an hour at h and d, OK?"
"I can't, I got a meeting at"
How exactly would this help us?
Maybe we're not ready for a baby.
This could be a test run.
Who would take care of the test run?
Take me home and love me.
Not in front of the puppy
Miranda had been backed into a corner
"Even though she was surrounded by bitches, she didn't wanna be one."
Charlotte and Trey were performing their usual duet.
and then I got out and found you.
I think I should come in.
"But thanks, I had a lovely time."
"That night, Charlotte got everything she wanted."
And at am Miranda was getting nothing but aggravated.
This is supposed to be your mom's heart beating orsomething.
I'm the only one taking care of it.
"For you, because you're not doing anything."
He's just getting used to us.
I'm so sick of you being the kid here.
I cannot be in charge all the time.
You think we can have a baby?
We can't even have a puppy together.
We're going through a rough patch.
"So you're just gonna give up on us, just like that?"
I have been trying not to give up on us for a long time.
"All this time, she thought the problem was her."
And there was never a good time to say what she had to say.
A baby would've been a quick fix for something that can't be fixed.
Because you don't want it to work.
I don't wanna fight you anymore.
"That night, Miranda lost her partner."
"The next day, she got a new one."
"Meanwhile, I was still enjoying my one."
Do you wanna have a sleepover?
I didn't know about Aidan but my light was definitely on.
I couldn't stop Big coming back into my life.
But I could stop him from coming out of my machine.
I'm gonna run down to the Korean.
"Yes and he's coming back, so Please."
"No, go home to your wife."
I had no idea what else Big was gonna say.
And I'm not sure what bugged me more.
That I didn't know or that I cared.
I can't fucking stop thinking about you.
Exactly what I had needed to hear a year too late.
"I should have been happy, but I wasn't."
It was the absolute worst timing of all.
"Ten minutes later, Aidan still hadn't come back."
Suddenly my life was all about timing.
All the right things said at all the wrong times.
My past coming back way too fast.
And my future taking way too long to come home.
"One unfortunate thing about ending a relationship in a city like New York is while you can emotionally move away from each other, you physically can't."
"I got a brief due, so"
There was nothing brief about it.
Steve and Miranda had been doing the polite avoid each other break up dance for three weeks.
I'm sorry it's taking me so long to find a place.
"I got a lead on one, though."
"I was gonna ask if you'd look at it with me, but that's weird, right?"
"When you find that place to move, you need to fill it with furniture."
That's why smart New Yorkers frequent the opening day of the New Designer showcase.
"At best, you're my booth bitch."
That's because I'm your booth bitch.
I'm going to get us some coffee.
I didn't need a blue ribbon panel to decide he was the finest new designer in the whole place.
"I'd often fantasized about running into my ex and his wife, but in those fantasies I was running into them with a truck."
I don't know howyou could like this clunky wood.
Can I showyou something in a hutch?
It's just not really our style.
We only like teeny tiny furniture.
"Sorry, I didn't get your names."
"This is Natasha, and this is Shit."
"No, I'll We should put cold water on this."
"Two hours later, it was time for the opening day party."
If you're referring to my boyfriend he's doing business.
Where did he learn to whittle like that?
How many drinks have you had?
"And Daniel Boone, is he a nice guy?"
Where is your sense of humor?
Guarding her bid on the silent auction.
She's got her eye on a beige chair.
Everything in my apartment is now beige.
"Yeah, well It doesn't quite fit."
We always used to share a cigarette together.
We did a lot of things that were bad for me together.
I have a secret to tell you.
If you know anyone who's interested
You should keep that to yourself.
He told me at the furniture show.
There's always a contest with an ex.
"He said, It's not working out."
"Then he leaned in and said, lf you know anyone who's interested"
You don't know anyone who is interested.
To save postage on his newsletter?
How dare he say that to you?
Married men never leave their wives.
"Even if he did, I have no intention of doing anything for two reasons I have a great boyfriend, and I'm not insane."
Didn't you feel like punching him?
It was too sad or something.
How long has he been married?
That's what happens when people jump into relationships too quickly.
Trey and l are nothing like Big and Natasha.
Trey and I really love each other.
Who wants to split a Reuben?
"I'm meeting his mother this week, and if all goes well"
Trey is this close to proposing.
I've had pairs of pantyhose longer.
"As Miranda looked around, she realized the contest was over."
Steve was the ex that was going to die alone and miserable.
There's gotta be a better place.
"I broke up with him, and he's got no money, no savings, no nothing."
There should be a city funded break up housing for those in need.
"A big orphanage where old boyfriends could think about what they did wrong and cry themselves to sleep in a clean, safe environment."
You think you don't really want him to move away?
"My head tells me it's time for him to leave, but the idea of him moving into a basement apartment in West Shit Street breaks my heart."
"It's a common belief that women use the left, emotional side of their brain and men the right, more logical side."
But is it really that cut and dry?
"When it comes to affairs of the heart, there's a battle between what we know and what we feel."
What do you do in a situation that leaps back and forth between the left and right side?
"In relationships, is it smarter to follow your heart or your head?"
This is Trey when he graduated from medical school.
"Later that week, Charlotte met the head and heart of Trey's family his mother, Bunny."
"Trey, you look so cute in a cap and gown"
That was before we jumped in the fountain and hell broke loose.
Count your blessings I didn't bring the one on the bearskin rug.
She's a bit of a camera nazi.
"If you insist on dragging us down memory lane, I'm getting a real drink."
"Excuse me, a Glenlivet rocks, please."
Maybe you should have a red wine instead.
"Thomas, we'd love some more nibbly cheese things."
"He's older than water, but never forgets a martini."
What are you two doing tonight?
Disappointing crab and the host was rude.
Maybe you should go to Cote Basque instead.
Charlotte was impressed with Bunny's technique.
Trey had been looking forward to Cloche all week.
"Meanwhile, downtown, Samantha was entertaining Adam Ball, a film editor who made a living cutting coming attractions for film companies."
I'm dating a guy with the funkiest tasting spunk.
"Sorry, but who else can I talk to about this?"
Have you ever had this problem?
But I have to admit it's never been a trip to Baskin Robins.
Like asparagus gone bad or something.
Can I cancel my rice pudding?
"Beautiful guy, great in bed, it's so disappointing."
It's like a bad bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau the first day of season.
They should put that on the pack to cut back sales.
Maybe there's something he could eat to make it sweeter.
You should write to Martha Stewart.
"Dear funky spunk, try a hint of mint."
At least it'll get your whites whiter.
Just don't give him head again.
I never even thought of that.
"He's healthy, and I don't swallow."
As long as you and the center for disease control are fine with it.
"He loves getting head, but what man doesn't?"
"If the come situation were reversed, do you think men would go near it?"
Miranda came home to something that was even harder to swallow.
If this is Steve's number This is Barbara.
"Steve, if this is you, call me."
I'd love to go to a movie sometime.
And on an answering machine across town
I need to talk to you about what I said the other day.
The right side of my brain told me to delete it.
"Seven playbacks later, I invited an impartial judge."
"He wants to get back together, right?"
The Hi and the It's important .
They still don't know who killed Kennedy.
It's obvious what you want to do or you wouldn't listen to it and what happened to the sane part of you?
I don't know.After the fifth playback he got in a little.
Steve got a message from a girl desperate for him to go to a movie.
"A year old guy with no money and no place to live because he's single, he's a catch."
"But a year old woman with a job and a great home because she's single, is considered tragic."
Let's listen to that message again.
"As soon as Miranda left, my emotions overruled both sides of my brain."
It's about getting out of my marriage.
"I didn't knowwhy I called or what I wanted, but suddenly my heart was racing."
"I thought about it, and it's going to cost me a lot."
You should forget about what I said.
"I made my bed, I should lie in it."
A shock treatment to jolt me back to sanity.
How long have they been there?
"Don't take this the wrong way, but this place could use a little work."
You got bucks worth of shoes.
"You could do little things plaster, strip the floors You have no idea how beautiful it would be if we took it down a level."
I don't know how to do that stuff.
lsn't that a lot of work?
A special lady needs a special home.
Here am I with a guy who wanted to make my home better.
Somewhere out there was a guy who wanted to pull it apart.
"It wasn't a left or right brainer, it was a no brainer."
Tell me why we're here again.
I'm making an effort to eat better.
After a browse on the healthysperm.
"com web page, Samantha invited Adam Ball to dinner."
"OK, here are your wheat grass shots."
I'll be right back with the menus.
Samantha fought the urge not to tell Adam Ball he didn't knowfrom funky.
How long does it take for wheat grass to work into your system?
"An hour and a half, two wheat grass shots and a ginger melon smoothie later, I'm coming."
"Man, man, man, you give good head."
"Excuse me, I'd like to change this for the rucola and endive."
You should try the tomato basil.
Mom was quite taken with you.
You are a dream come true.
"Charlotte knewthis was the moment, that magic moment where Trey was going to ask her to be his wife."
Doesn't this look like a little plate of heaven?
What is it about you Charlotte?
You always know just what I want.
"I suggested he have a tomato salad, then I suggested we get married."
The upsetting thing is proposing to a guy who says all righty .
I was the one supposed to say yes.
Who cares about those stupid rules?
"And you want to marry him, right?"
"Yes, but there was no kneeling."
"There was no ring, no nothing."
This is an awful engagement story.
What am I supposed to tell my kids?
"Mommy really wanted to get married, so Daddy said, All righty ."
Miranda realized he was with the girl executive.
She finally got it into her head.
I took the dog out already.
I'll get out of here today.
Thanks for letting me sleep on your couch.
I think we did pretty good.
"I was gonna say, Keep in touch , but that would be weird."
I guess we could do that.
You said I wouldn't be bothered.
I'll be at the Stanhope Hotel.
At least let me pay for it.
This is why I don't do home repairs.
She demanded your address so she could send flowers.
Charlotte had done the impossible in New York.
She was engaged to her heart's desire.
"Unfortunately, she couldn't get the way it happened out of her head."
I think we should stop here for a minute.
Maybe we should go in and find you the most beautiful ring they have.
"From that moment on, Charlotte would tell everyone that in front of Tiffany's, out of nowhere, Trey popped the question."
"And she said, All righty ."
I'm not really in the mood for that tonight.
"Come on, baby, you give the greatest head."
"Well, Adam You've got funky tasting spunk."
"I've heard bad excuses for not giving head, but this one takes the cake."
You're a two blow job chick.
They're in the coming attractions but I'll never see them in the movie.
Then give me a little BJ.
"Up and down a couple of times, it's easy."
You men have no idea what we're dealing with down there.
"Teeth placement, jaw stress, suction, and gag reflex, all the while bobbing up and down, moaning and trying to breathe."
"Honey, they don't call it a job for nothin'."
"Now, having said all that, with the right man it can be fabulous."
"That is, unless the man has spunk that's like the rotten egg buffet."
"Come on, it can't be that bad."
I'll make a deal with you.
"If you're fine with it, I'll be fine with it."
"It's not gay, if it's you."
"Ten minutes later, Samantha learnt how far men would go for a blow job."
"She gave him head, but her heart wasn't in it."
How did you know I was here?
I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you too.
"What are you doing, calling my house, following me to hotels?"
Could you sit down for one minute and listen to me?
"I have a boyfriend and a deadline, and you have a wife and a drinking problem."
I was an asshole the other day.
"When I said I was leaving, you didn't say anything."
"This has to stop flirting, jerking me around, calling my boyfriend."
"He doesn't know about you, and I don't want him to."
"Go, lie in your beige bed."
I haven't explained this very well.
"The thing is, fuck, I miss you."
I have to talk to you.
What is it you have to say?
"My mind was yelling how angry I was, but my heart Fuck me."
And just like that I lost my head.
One ofthe best things about being in a great relationship is feeling comfortable enough to leave it for an evening.
What do you girls do when you get together?
"The usual stuff braid our hair, crank calls, and that weekend stuff."
You don't talk about the boys?
Sometimes there is talk of the boys.
I thought it was hair loss.
Feel free to pass that on to the gals.
I'll try to work that into the conversation.
EB White said no one should come to New York unless they're lucky.
"I had an amazing boyfriend who had all his hair, good friends and a married ex boyfriend I had slept with a week ago."
"Samantha had invited us to celebrate her new apartment, three new clients and her general fabulousness."
Who knew this existed in the meatpacking district.
Just yards away from decaying cows.
"I had them delivered, along with dinner, the wine and DVD of An Affair To Remember that we're watching later, drunk."
I used this new delivery service.
Anything you want they bring within an hour.
You didn't fuck the delivery guy
"No, John, the hot guy from the gym."
The condoms came faster than he did
"Ladies, we have it all great apartments, jobs, friends, and sex"
We can have quiche delivered and eat it too.
"At my age, my mother had three kids and a drunk husband."
You just have three drunk friends.
Having it all really means having someone special to share it with.
My life wasn't complete until I met Trey.
And Trey's mom is so great.
You'll meet her at the engagement party she's throwing for us.
I can take care of this.
"Three hours later, Deborah Kerr had revealed her secret to Cary Grant, and I'd still told no one mine."
I slept with Big last week.
"Just one night, and it is not happening again."
I don't know what I was doing.
Nothing men haven't been doing for centuries.
"It was great, and it's not happening again."
How can it feel so good when it's so bad?
Big and l We have this thing.
We're just animals reacting to smells.
"I have a great boyfriend with all his hair, waiting for me, who smells great."
Aidan hasn't said l love you yet.
"Until then, you're a free agent."
I'm more old fashioned than you think.
I don't wanna be a free agent.
"Don't you wanna judge me, just a little bit?"
You gotta go see the girls more often.
It had all just been a bad dream.
"As long as I was near Aidan, it would all be OK."
Why do you have to go to Pennsylvania today?
It's got owners that miss it very much.
It's just for a couple of days.
You gotta have stuff you wanna do.
What I needed to do was not be alone.
"Downtown, Samantha woke up to discover she did have it all."
"She never wanted a man around in the morning, until she needed one."
I wondered if you might be able to drop by on your way to work.
"Honey, I can hardly blow my nose, let alone blow you."
"Yeah, I wouldn't want you to get sick, either."
"Later, in the bridal registry department at Bergdorf Goodman, Charlotte discovered, she wanted it all, and more."
We do very well with it.
It'll look lovely under the noodles we'll have to eat due to my outstanding loans.
I'm too crazy about you to say no.
I gotta get back to the hospital.
Did you do a guest list for the party?
Everyone in the family has one.
Feel free to have your lawyer look it over.
Charlotte wasted no time having a lawyer look it over.
"We're not married yet, and already we're talking about divorce."
A lot of people do prenups.
Marriage is supposed to be about love and happiness.
per cent of marriages end in divorce.
"I'm sure you'll live happily ever after, but I wouldn't marry without this."
What's he gonna take from me shoes?
He has you on a vesting schedule.
"For every five years you're married, you get a percentage of"
"If you have any boys, you'll get another grand."
I can't marry someone knowing they feel this way.
This is just their opening offer.
I can't even buy stuff on sale.
I'm sure his lawyers will take care of this.
The New York office is tougher than ours.
"George, this is Carrie and Charlotte."
George works in our Chicago office.
I'm taking depositions and restaurant recommendations from hip and trendy New Yorkers.
I hope the place tomorrow lives up to your standards.
I'm sure it will be great.
I'll drop by your office later.
"Well, well, well, they sure grow 'em cute in the Midwest."
Find out how much he pays for boys before you get attached.
"and two pages of her black book later, Samantha was no closer to closing her deal."
Why don't you go fuck yourself.
I won't be doing it againever.
Samantha was discovering it was easier to find a guy to screw her than one who'd screw in her curtain rod.
She wasn't the only one who needed a fix.
I did everything I could to keep busy until Aidan came back.
"I re arranged my sweaters, defrosted my fridge broke into my emergency hidden stash, and thought about choices."
"Modern women have been told that we can be anything we want an astronaut, the head of an lnternet company, a stay at home mom."
"And apparently, they can all be delivered to your door."
Is it possible that we've gotten so spoiled by choices that we've become unable to make one?
"That we know that once you choose something, one man, one great apartment, one amazing job, another option goes away?"
Are we a generation who can't choose just one from column 'A'?
"Did we have too much to handle, or was Samantha right?"
"Two hours later, I had filed every article I'd ever written, but I couldn't file away what had happened with Big."
We need to talk about what happened.
It was just a physical thing.
"We gave in to our baser instincts, shit happens, blah blah blah."
"But it was pretty fucking amazing, wasn't it?"
That is so not the point.
We have to learn to rise above the physical stuff.
You can learn to do that?
Next time we're going to a hotel.
I can smell the guy on your sheets.
"By the way, there will be no next time."
This is gonna be like The Bridges Of Madison Avenue .
A brief affair I'll write about to my grandchildren.
Can I have a beard in the book version?
It all felt so easy and so good.
I was like the moth to the old flame.
"Meanwhile that night, Miranda was enjoying her new flame."
Can't believe I have to catch an o' clock flight.
"If I weren't going back to Chicago, I would try to sleep with you now."
I have to wait till next time.
There will be a next time?
I come back and forth a lot.
"In the meantime, there's always the phone."
"The next night, Miranda was surprised to hear from George."
I knew you were a middle child.
I love it when I'm right.
"Yeah, spoken like a true only child."
They talked for two hours about everything.
"Favorite foods, families It was one of the best dates Miranda had had."
Then the date got even better.
I would start by kissing your neck
"Then I'd work my way down, start licking your nipples"
Put the other one on you.
"That night, Miranda started sleeping with George regularly."
"She had it all her own life, and a great boyfriend she could count on."
"He always called, and she always came to the phone."
"While Miranda came, I was busy preparing for Aidan to come back."
I had slept in Big's and my sex sheets for two days.
"Like any good junky, I knew how to hide the evidence."
I was sure he saw the scarlet 'A' on my chest.
"If Big could smell him, could he smell Big on me?"
I should send you to Pennsylvania more often.
I realized something while I was gone.
Around Trenton I thought I shouldn't say
"Not only was my secret safe, but I had become lovable."
"You're bent over, and I'm playing with you."
Your dick is in my mouth.
"The next night, Miranda was going to third with George when her second line beeped."
Trey says his mom won't negotiate.
Your dick is in my mouth.
The mom's the one holding the cards.
She's the one to go up against.
"You got me so hot, I just came."
Now we have to take care of you.
"The next night, I went to take care of Samantha."
Which for Samantha meant making her mom's childhood remedy cough syrup and Fanta orange soda over ice.
"No offence, but this is about to make me sicker than you."
A frosted martini glass would make that more appetizing.
Why don't you ask the super to fix your window?
Then at least I'd have a curtain that closes.
"Oh, Carrie, it doesn't matter how much you have."
"If you don't have a guy who cares about you, it all means shit."
Three days of sleep deprivation had turned Samantha into a new woman Charlotte.
"For someone who had it all, she had never felt more alone."
"There's two types of guys out there the ones that hold your hand, and the ones that fuck you."
I'd slept with both of them in the last hours.
The guys that fuck you aren't worth a damn.
"Three days of rest later, three healthy girls attended a very uptown party."
Looks like Martha Stewart exploded in here.
Amazing what days of a cough syrup and Fanta diet will do for the appetite.
I can't believe Charlotte wants to be in this world.
They're like Ken and Barbie cut outs.
I see you found the bar.
"Trey, you have to keep people out of the maid's room."
There are photos of me rowing college crew in there.
Maybe we should say hello before he gets into the Scotch.
It's about years too late for that.
"I love him, but I feel like no one cares about me."
"I thought if we could negotiate, it'd be OK, but now it all feels wrong."
He leaves it to his mother.
We can't tell you what to do.
"I wasn't one to talk about marriage, considering I might break one up."
You have to do what feels right to you.
It depends how much you want to marry Trey.
"Bunny, do you have a minute?"
"Charlotte realized, if she wanted to close the deal with Trey, she'd have to close the deal with Bunny first."
I have a little problem with how much I'm worth.
It's how it's always been done in the MacDougal family.
"Not only would she have to negotiate, she'd have to play hardball."
"Well, you know we haven't finalized the wedding arrangements."
Trey would be disappointed if I backed out.
"The Times announcement would run, there would be questions"
"I negotiated with Bunny, and I signed the prenup."
"Ladies, may I sweep my bride away?"
It was then that we realized that we didn't have it all.
I can't believe she's marrying that guy.
For a tenth of what she's worth.
I thought you were Ms Pro Marriage now.
I also saw spots all over my bathtub.
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but it feels weird without her here."
That's such a Charlotte thing to say.
"After a week full of Aidan and no cigarettes, I felt like I had finally kicked my addiction."
Not with the wrong word in down.
Come down or I'll come up.
I told Aidan I was taking Pete for a walk.
"He believed me, which only made it worse."
Don't ever call me at home again.
"You can't just decide you wanna see me, and I'm there."
"You want it all the girl you screw, and the girl you go home to."
"I can't do this any more, sleep with two people at the same time."
"Married men don't just leave their I have a man who loves me, and you have a wife who loves you."
Don't talk about him and her like it's you and me.
You have no right to do this.
You can't come and fuck up my life.
I think there were two people doing the fucking here.
"Back at Miranda's home, things were heating up as well."
"I unbutton the last button, slip my hand in, and touch your breast."
"Yeah, I'm touching your breast, and I'm thrusting into you."
"No, we hadn't gotten to that yet."
Are you having phone sex with other people?
I don't think we ever said this was an exclusive thing.
Miranda stopped being hung up on George.
So she hung up on him.
"Three hours later, I hadn't found Pete, and I felt as lost as he was."
"I had a man who loved me, and a man who wanted to leave his wife for me."
"I should have been on top of the world, but I didn't feel like I had it all."
"I had lost Pete, and I would probably lose Aidan."
"Jesus, I was worried about you."
"Oh, my God, I lost him."
"I lost him and I looked for him and Oh, my Pete, come here."
I need to ask you something.
You took Pete for a walk.
We both know you're not big on the dog walking.
I can smell the smoke on you.
We've got to stop meeting like this.
You've been waiting your whole life to say that.
I have to be some place in three hours.
Why is your skin so soft?
"When Dickens wrote, lt was the best of times, it was the worst of times , he must have been having an affair with his married ex boyfriend."
You can't keep changing the time.
I have to put my diaphragm in.
I have to be at work in minutes.
Our affair like our hotels had gone from elegant with crystal to seedy with plastic cups.
"God, it's hot in here, and the windows don't even open"
I hate those sliding air strip things.
"Because it's on h and h, where nobody knows us."
I don't give a fuck who sees us.
You want people to get hurt?
This room smells like take out curry.
"It's too hot, I can't do this."
Are you saving it for your boyfriend?
You don't talk to me that way.
I have to tell you something.
"I'd rather tell anyone but you, but I have to."
I'm having an affair with Big.
I think my heart just stopped.
I'm smoking and sleeping with Big.
Feel free to delete me out of your Palm Pilot.
You are such a good friend.
If only I didn't hate me.
How long has it been going on?
"I'm in the middle of this, and I can't see."
I need you to yank me out of it.
Say stuff to yank me out of it.
I would die if he found out.
I'm afraid he'll call him or do something stupid.
What did you think would happen?
I'm terrified we've messed it up and it can never be what it was supposed to be.
Does he only want me because he can't have me?
I want everyone to get out of this without getting hurt.
You've heard stories about affairs where people realise how great their other relationship is and end it without anyone being the wiser.
I don't watch Lifetime Television For Women .
"If the world according to bride knew, she'd kill me."
At least you wouldn't have to be a bridesmaid.
"While Miranda was trying not to judge me on the Upper East Side, Samantha was judging the crowd at a hot spot on the Lower West Side."
"It was a typical mix ten per cent Wall Street, ten per cent real estate, ten per cent she'd slept with."
"A Manhattan legend straight, single, and sexually very active."
"We knowthe same people, we should go to dinner, blah blah."
You could qualify for the Olympics.
"Oh my, so Cirque du Soleil."
You haven't fucked till you've fucked in the swing.
I've always wanted to run off and join the circus.
"So, Samantha when was your last AlDS test?"
"Anyone who has as much sex as us has to ask, right?"
I was tested again three weeks ago.
Samantha didn't know howto tell Tom Reymi that the only sex test she'd ever taken was the Cosmo Quiz.
I got hard in that club just from looking at you.
We both know what's gonna happen when we get in that swing.
"I can't fuck you or eat you how I want, unless I know it's safe."
I am as good as they say.
Samantha had to figure out just how much she wanted to do Reymi.
The pink Post its are for the gowns I kinda like.
Green is for the gowns I kinda really like.
Yellow is for the gowns I don't know if I like.
Drag a sharp object across my throat.
And I'll take Annoying Bride ?
Is your theme a Nazi wedding?
And I like that satin bow.
Have you all had an AlDS test?
I met this very hot guy.
He won't sleep with me unless I have a test.
Could you not talk about AlDS now?
You've never had an HlV test?
How can you not have had a test?
She doesn't mean that the way it sounds.
Sometimes it takes me a long time to get over a cold.
The worst part is waiting for the results.
"They take some people to this room, and you knowthe news ain't good."
"I sat there praying, Please don't take me in that room ."
There are gowns in this magazine.
I have only seen of them.
Some minion to do your dress bidding.
I can hire someone to do that?
You can hire someone to do anything.
If only I could hire someone to take that test.
"Later, I got thinking about safe sex."
"Odd how only when our physical life is at risk, do we protect ourselves."
Wouldn't it be nice if there was a pamphlet to warn us what behaviour might be high risk to ourselves or our relationships?
"Even if you take precautions and emotionally try to protect yourself, when you crawl in bed with someone, is sex ever safe?"
"Yeah, I know, but that's not my problem."
"The next day, Miranda experienced a different type of high risk behaviour."
"It was bad enough she had just lost a case, but now she was being harassed by a sandwich."
"You want pasta, you go to Little ltaly."
"You want wedding, you go Wang."
"You want the perfect wedding dress, go to Anthony, stylist."
"For these prices, we should be pulling her nose out of our asses."
Anthony was like the pushy mother she never had.
Duchess satin with the lace applique.
"The sharmoose, strapless, with the net overlay."
None of these are right at all.
I hope she doesn't think I'm a bitch.
"She's not paid to think, but to make you happy."
I've been imagining my wedding dress ever since I was a little girl.
I want it to be perfect.
I've done this a million times.
You'll know the right dress when you see it.
"Across town, Samantha felt as though she might cry as well."
Have you had an HlV test before?
Why are you taking this test?
How many sexual partners have you had?
"While Samantha tried to remember her sexual past, I came face to face with my sexual present."
"It's just a sound I make, I guess."
I'll try not to do it anymore.
You used to like that sound I make.
"I'm in a weird place right now, but I'll be out of it soon."
I just need time to figure it out.
I'll give you room to do that.
"You're not saying that in a bad way, right?"
"I didn't know what I was doing, but I was sure I had just entered high risk relationship behaviour."
"Three days later, Miranda had got her fill of the sandwich."
You're not allowed to harass women like that.
I'd like to speak to the manager.
That sandwich says sexually explicit things to women as they walk by.
He didn't say it in the sandwich way.
He said it in the sexual harassing way.
Then Miranda glimpsed just enough of his full lips and shiny white teeth to stop thinking about the sandwich and start wondering about the man inside.
I can't stop thinking about him.
You're turned on by a sandwich?
It's the fact that I can't see him.
Any man who propositions a woman from a sandwich must be a troll.
That's the first laugh I've had in weeks.
Thank the sandwich when you have sex.
I can't have sex with a sandwich.
I never thought I'd have sex with a married ex.
Can a hoagy be that far behind?
"Miranda, what the hell am I gonna do?"
"As Samantha waited for her results, she had one thought over and over."
Don't let them take me into that little room.
"Ms Jones, I've got your results."
Samantha began to realise she was being taken into that little room.
The nurse just wanted a quiet place to lecture her on safe sex practises.
"Days later, somehow I found myself back at the corner of h and Safeth."
That Japanese businessman thinks I'm a hooker.
What are you doing in this neighbourhood?
I was doing business in the area.
"I just checked on my wedding dress, it's at the tailor and"
"It was a force bigger than me, like Niagara Falls, you know?"
"I mean I know I am, but I am not that woman."
"Please, I feel bad enough already."
Do you ever think about how she'd feel if she found out?
I think about it all the time.
"You think about what would happen to you, not about her."
You don't know anything about her.
Howwould you feel if someone did this to me?
Can I please help you pack now?
"So we stood and bubble wrapped, the bride to be and her maid of dishonour."
A week of fantasising sex with the sandwich man had gotten to Miranda.
"Safe or not, she needed to see who she was dealing with."
"Even though he was cute, Miranda walked away."
What did they have in common?
"Later, at Tom Reymi's, after a week of sheer anxiety, Samantha enjoyed the benefits of totally safe sex."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry
It was the lowest of the low.
"I had made love to my married ex boyfriend on his lunch hour at his apartment, while his year old wife was sunning herself at the Hamptons."
Could I feel any more like a hooker?
Why do you keep doing that to yourself?
We should stop seeing each other.
I'm gonna call her right now.
What are you gonna do call her at the beach and say you love me and want a divorce?
You don't want me to call her because you love that other guy.
This is about that other guy.
You could have told her by now.
You told me not to tell her.
"If I make that call, are you gonna be there for me?"
"Are we gonna do this, really?"
"I mean, out in the daylight, no cocktails, no hotel rooms, real life?"
You know howto let yourself out.
I couldn't help but wonder if I really did knowthe way to let myself out.
What did l really know about Natasha?
Natasha is a woman who likes tea roses.
Natasha comes home from the Hamptons early.
"I knew you were having an affair, but not in my house."
"I had assumed, the one who would be hurt would be me."
She lost a tooth and needed a stitch in her lip.
"They had a plastic surgeon, and it won't scar."
Her parents are on the way.
We need a newword for over .
Where have you been all day?
"Somehow, I had found a way to let myself out of the mess."
"For Miranda, the only thing worse than being Charlotte's year old bridesmaid was being a year old bridesmaid without a date."
"With the wedding approaching, Miranda fell prey to the siren song of a singles event."
"bought you seven mini dates, each eight minutes long which is as long as blind dates should be."
Private wealth group at Morgan Stanley lnvestment Management for high net worth individuals and pension plans.
"Like my job, been there five years, divorced, no kids, not religious."
"I live in New Jersey, speak French and Portuguese."
I'm a lawyer at a mid sized firm.
I went to Harvard Law School.
"But before the wedding bells, there's the rehearsal dinner."
You said you were a stewardess.
Men are threatened by good jobs.
"I'd finally ended my affair with Big, but the guilt of lying to Aidan was like a hangover I couldn't sleep off."
"I'm just saying, as a lawyer a partner, no less I got zero dates."
"As a stewardess, I got one for tomorrow."
The correct term is flight attendant .
Not if you wanna get laid.
It's how you say what you do that matters.
"For example, I'm in PR ."
Translation l give great head .
"Yeah, but you can't date the guy now because you lied."
If he got upset he'd look completely shallow.
And it would make you look schizo.
"I We See, mother, I told you I'd become a we sooner or later."
"I'd like to thank everyone for coming, especially the out of towners."
"My cousin Caleb, who's in the wedding party, came from Edinburgh."
"Someone had to bring the real Scotch, like."
I knowwhat I'll be having later.
But the person I'd really like to thank for showing up is this woman here.
I love you more than words can say.
Those who know me know I'm a man of many words.
"Let's eat, drink, and be married."
She doesn't have to be a bridesmaid.
The groomsmen have to wear kilts.
I like the idea of men in skirts easy access.
Is it true that they wear nothing underneath?
I'll find out and get back to you.
First time in New York City?.
"But if his tongue could do that, she wondered what it could do to her."
I'd be happy to showyou around town.
"Trey got lost bringing me back from the Stanhope Hotel, like."
Samantha wasn't the only one feeling lost.
I'm thinking I have to tell him.
I might have to tell him about Big.
Relationships are supposed to be built on trust.
"No offence, but that ship has sailed."
"You have to tell him, but not before the wedding."
"You get a day, not a week."
There's no reason to tell him.
Men lie about this all the time.
You fucked Big all over Manhattan.
Why should he find out now?
Could you not use the f word in Vera Wang?
"If my boyfriend was sleeping with somebody else for three weeks, I'd wanna know about it."
I'd wanna have all the information.
That might mean more coming from someone not posing as a stewardess.
"Nothing, but at your wedding we have to pretend Miranda's a stewardess."
And I don't want you and Aidan fighting.
Don't you think this could be a little shorter?
The skirts must the same length.
"It's a kilt, and it's tradition."
Can't I ask you not to wear your dress round your see you next Tuesday?
Was that a Schoolhouse Rock I missed?
"If I have to be a bridesmaid, I'd at least like to look good."
You don't have to be a bridesmaid.
"Frankly, I didn't want you to feel left out."
I would love to be left out.
I could be in bed with a hot Scot right now.
"Maybe coming clean is the ultimate selfish act, a way to absolve yourself by hurting someone who doesn't deserve to be hurt."
I cheated on a test in the fifth grade with two friends.
They confessed and failed the class.
"I never told anyone, and it never mattered."
"In a relationship, is honesty really the best policy?"
"Evidently, dishonesty was the best policy for Miranda."
"As a stewardess, she was a charming date."
"Once you work first class, you can't go back to coach."
You get to eat the cookies?
There's always some actress who doesn't want her cookie.
"Free travel, cookies this sounds like a great job."
You've got the great job a New York ER.
"You are, in the event of an emergency."
Inflatable slide I'm in charge of that.
"But once we open the slide, it's every man for himself."
"That night, Harris got to make love to a stewardess."
Miranda didn't have to fake anything.
"I'd love to ask you to spend the night, but I've got an early flight to DC."
I should get some rest too.
Saturdays at the hospital are non stop since roller blades were invented.
Do you have a boy in every port?
"In truth, it's a lonely life."
There's a wedding I'm in on Sunday.
"Days later, the four of us celebrated Charlotte's last night as a single woman."
I can't believe you're getting married.
I'm headed for a storybook ending.
"The little girl had an affair, lied to her boyfriend, and lived happily ever after."
"Marriage doesn't guarantee a happy ending, just an ending."
It's also the end of the possibility that your next great fuck is around the corner.
fuck is just around the corner.
I finally get to sleep with Trey.
You haven't slept with him yet?
"Before you buy the car, you take it for a test drive."
I wanted to save myself until we got married.
"I am with him, and it's romantic."
It's romantic until he can't figure out where to put it in.
"He's so sexy, and he loves me."
I want to do things to him that I have never done to anybody.
"The other night, I was thinking of putting whipped cream all over my body."
Low fat Cool Whip is the best.
It's less sticky than other brands.
Those of us not getting married celebrated with a booty call.
Samantha's vertical Scotch tasting that turned into a horizontal one.
I had no idea you Yanks were so bloody friendly.
"She couldn't understand him, but understood he was hard."
"I decided to crawl into bed with Aidan, but he wasn't in his bed."
I was trying to surprise you.
You can't surprise a man with a dog.
This is for Charlotte and Trey?
You wanted to give them a piece of my furniture.
You didn't have to make something.
We could have picked a piece.
I make all that stuff too.
"I know, but this is too nice."
I wanted it to mean something.
"God, I was about to get them steak knives."
It's two different types of wood from two different trees.
"They blend together and make it stronger, just like"
Kind of like two people in love.
Are you gonna make fun of this?
It's really nicer than anyone deserves.
This big old flaw right here?
It's just the way the wood is.
This was the time to tell him.
I could feel the words inside me.
"But if I told him, could he still love me?"
I wasn't ready to find out.
There was another booty call that night.
And today is officially our wedding day.
And I can't wait any longer.
Could we please make love right now?
Take me to your bedroom now.
Has this ever happened to you before?
I just didn't think it would happen with you.
Sometimes intercourse just doesn't do it for me.
"I can get the sails up, just can't bring it into the harbor."
Is there anything I can do?
Sex is such a small part of it for us.
That's what I love about you.
It's not just about the sex.
Charlotte couldn't sleep at all that night.
All I could think about was that I was a cheater.
"I cheated and lied in fifth grade, and I was still doing it."
I can't have you sneaking out at in the morning for a cigarette.
Well I'll just have to learn to live with it.
You said you can't date a smoker.
It was trusting me with his heart.
"Aidan, I need to tell you something."
But suddenly I couldn't tell him.
I was afraid he'd never look at me that way again.
Let's go back and go to bed.
"My stuff's at home, the stuff for the wedding."
Just pick me up in the morning.
"The groom is in a kilt, so pretty"
You haven't made breakfast till you've made it at feet in turbulence.
Stop putting it in my face.
"I think it's really bad, look."
Assistant Manager of Athlete's Foot at t and Broadway.
I always wanted to sleep with a stewardess.
"For a moment, Miranda considered coming clean."
"But then they'd both be liars, and he wouldn't have slept with a stewardess."
I hope I never have you on one of my flights.
I wouldn't be on first class.
That love seat packs up nice.
You look too hot to be a bridesmaid.
I thought the whole point was to wear a bad dress and be humiliated.
It's not that kind of wedding.
I thought maybe one day I'd build us a love seat.
I'm just gonna grab my I was supposed to be at the church ten minutes ago.
You never let me hold you anymore.
Why do you keep running away?
"Aidan, I slept with my ex boyfriend."
You met him at the furniture show.
"I didn't tell you, and I'm sorry."
I don't knowwhat I was thinking.
Will you meet me there later?
Please don't bleed on my dress.
"Charlotte, my grandmother's necklace looks beautiful on you."
Could I escort you to your seat?
He asked if he could escort you to your seat.
"They do wear something under kilts, but it's easy to get off."
"Charlotte had something old, something new, something borrowed, and someone Samantha blew."
"Despite all her bitching, Samantha enjoyed being a bridesmaid."
"Miranda, back to being herself, found a last minute date."
I have to tell you something.
Last night he couldn't get it up.
"I was drunk, he was fine."
Then it must have been wedding night jitters.
"Since she was in the white dress, I reached for a white lie."
I should have slept with him on the first date.
"Maybe he jerked off before you got there, and he was too embarrassed to tell you."
"If you don't wanna go through this, you don't have to."
"We'll just get a cab, and everyone will just have to get over it."
"Charlotte was single, and standing in a dress."
Not even a low libido could stop her.
Could you hold this for a second?
I walked around for about an hour.
Couldn't bring myself to go in.
I never meant to hurt you.
Couldn't it be like the wood?
"That's my flaw, and and you're the other wood, and that makes us stronger."
I wish I didn't know about this.
I just wanted to be honest with you.
This is not the kind of thing I can get over.
I just need to be on my own for a while.
"Carrie, they need us for photos."
It's hard to find people who will love you no matter what.
I was lucky enough to find three of them.
"After a sordid affair with my ex boyfriend, and a break up with my current one, it was time for a change of scenery."
You're going to LA without me
You went on your honeymoon without us.
"While we planned our escape, Charlotte celebrated her return."
She and Trey had just returned from Bermuda.
"Here, Trey and I are playing golf."
Do you think the studio will send a limo to pick us up?
They're making your column a film.
It's a little company that's just talking about optioning my columns.
I was just practicing my LA spin.
Here's one of Trey pretending to get a hole in one.
Did you notice we're both wearing Bermuda shorts?
You kids were crazy down there
"I'd love to stay, but I've gotta take my cat to the kennel."
The car's picking us up at one.
"Welcome back, you old married lady."
I told Aidan about the affair.
We never had sex on honeymoon.
Shall we get more coffee or shall we get guns and kill ourselves?
"It was so frustrating, we started playing golf."
"After many days of golf, Charlotte's handicap had gone down twelve."
Trey's handicap had stayed the same.
"He was nervous about the wedding, the honeymoon and the golf."
He played really badly one day.
What do you want me to say?.
I only agreed to this trip to get away from Aidan and the whole mess.
I can't go to Los Angeles without new shoes.
"You go, I'm gonna stay and have another cup."
Call me if you need me.
"Later, three single New Yorkers arrived in the City of Angels."
To sit in a fake fish tank in underwear?
What do you think he's reading?
Words I'm never fond of hearing.
"I have reservations for Jones and Bradshaw, but not Hobbes."
"The production company requested two rooms, and we're booked up."
"Until then, could you stay with one of your friends?"
You're on a non smoking floor.
Words I'm even less fond of hearing.
"Later, decked out in our New York goes to LA finest, we were ready for a night on the town."
"Back in the hotel bar, we realized the three hour time difference made us three hours late for cocktail hour."
You know I'm from out of town?
"If you lived here, we would have met by now."
What do you do when you're not a one man welcome wagon?
I'm the number two selling model in the US.
You gotta love that metric system.
"You think I'm yanking your chain, but I'm not."
"We're having a promotional party at Hustler Store, celebrating the launch of a new line of toys and accessories."
As Samantha said goodbye to Mr.
"Dildo, Miranda said hello to Mr."
It's spelled D l Q U E.
"And yes, I've thought about changing it."
It would be worse if your first name was Little.
I thought I had it bad.
It is so great to talk to a smart and funny woman.
It's great to talk to a smart woman.
Could you excuse me for a second?
I was having drinks with the most feared creature in Los Angeles the junior development executive.
I will be when I turn
"Last year, he pitched me nothing but shit"
"You've had your heart broken, I've had my heart broken."
"If I have, that means other girls have."
"If other girls have, that means big opening weekend."
"Not X Men big, but chick flick big."
The guy who came up with that term should have his balls cut off.
I hope I don't sound like an asshole.
I'm not good with celebrity names.
Why would he wanna be involved?
"He's a producer as well, and he took to the material."
"In New York, Charlotte was dealing with a bed that was cold, coldy, cold."
I won't sleep until I've entered all these wedding gifts.
Sleep was the last thing Charlotte hoped Trey would do in bed.
"I've listed the gifts, who it's from, and the addresses."
Make it a breeze when you send out the thank you notes.
I can't wait till this wedding nonsense is behind us.
Then we can relax and just be a regular man and wife.
Jamesons were crystal candlesticks and Sullivans were silver?
"You know, since we've been home, I've been feeling so much more relaxed, haven't you?"
Handy and their Steuben glass bowl.
"Charlotte walked back to her big Park Avenue bed, wishing she had remembered to register for a sex life."
"When visiting LA, there are two things you must do one is rent a fabulous car, two is learn how to drive it."
You said you could drive a stick.
I did a few times in a parking lot.
Why didn't you get an automatic?
I believed that cars are to Los Angeles what handbags are to New York.
LA is supposed to be flat.
To get there we have to go up this hill.
I'm not going to die in this tin can.
I have a date with a dildo.
"Come on, we're gonna do it."
"A little later, freshly showered and freaked out, I drove to the studio for my meeting with Matthew McConaughey."
"There aren't any hills in there, are there?"
"Go down there, make a left."
"It's sharp, edgy, brutal at times."
Here's what I've been thinking about how do we get your column to translate to the silver screen?
I think I've got the answer.
What if we flush out the central relationship?
I don't see why they couldn't make it work.
I flew miles to have Matthew McConaughey ask what I've asked myself for years?
He is such a great guy.
I don't know anybody any cooler than Mr.
"The only question is, What the fuck is Carrie's problem?"
Well I don't particularly think it was just her problem.
"That's bullshit, Carrie, and you know it."
That's why I wanna develop the story with you.
"I really wanna fuck you, baby."
"We're made of head, heart and loins."
"We're talking about using them, am I right?"
I have The girl said that we would talk about the columns today.
Let's get down to the underbelly of these two characters.
Let's figure out why they're so fucked up.
"Well, I have a facial at four."
I don't understand why we can't be together.
Do you mind if I smoke?
I don't think Carrie should smoke.
"After I left the meeting I took a wrong turn and somehow found myself right back where I had started back in New York, back wondering about Big."
"I had come to LA for a vacation, hoping to get away from Big, Aidan, and most of all myself."
"Sitting on the fake set, all my issues felt more real than ever."
"I couldn't help but wonder no matter how far you travel or run from it, can you ever really escape your past?"
"In New York, the release of a new book is cause for celebration."
"Here in LA, a new line of sex toys will do the trick."
Do you think it's cream filled?
I am exhausted from McConaughey mania.
"I wanna get into bed, go to sleep and pretend this day never happened."
Garth is gonna autograph some dildos.
He's the John Grisham of penises.
"I can't believe how open and Hi, have sex this place is."
"In New York sex is bottom shelf, paper bag."
Last night I talked to this cute guy.
We were having a great time.
"Then a woman in a tight dress walked by, with big breasts just boom, here they are."
I wanted to have sex but it was hidden in my witty banter and my little looks.
She put it out there and got the guy.
But how long did she have him?
I admire women who can put it out there where you can see it.
You want to dress like her?
Do you think there's any chance she's not up for sex?
I was telling my friend how much I admire what you're wearing.
Are you in the porn industry?
My opinion of Canadian consumers just went up a notch.
"To Samantha, who's staying at the Standard, room"
"That night, Samantha took home the Deluxe Garth."
"Next door, I learned that not only could I not escape my past, I couldn't escape my present."
What is it about California air?
It makes me sleep so well.
I have another meeting with McConaughey and his partners to brainstorm what goes wrong with Carrie and her relationships.
I've got something to make you feel better.
"My friend went to California, and all I got was this lousy dildo."
In LA no one cares if your egg whites have a side of cock.
The average woman is only five inches deep.
Is that written on your placemat?
The mark of a fine penis is width
That's why you'll enjoy your presents.
Are you saying that Garth has the perfect girth?
"As much as I enjoy the fine life like craftsmanship, I'm going to leave mine with you."
LA isn't working out the way I had hoped.
"Meanwhile, back in New York and still no closer to being in put by Trey, Charlotte addressed thank you notes."
"Every time she licked a love stamp, it made a mockery of her marriage."
What if he really is impotent?
What kind of impotence do you think it is?
The kind that makes it soft.
Have you asked him about it?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Here's what to do put a ring of paper around his penis while he's asleep.
I sound like a perverted Nancy Drew.
"If it rips overnight, he is capable of an erection."
"Dildo out for dim sum, and then some."
Well I think that's pretty obvious.
"Don't you wanna know more about me, my interests?"
Garth wanted Samantha to know that he was more than just a sex toy.
Do you want to hear one?
"Far away, Charlotte was dealing with Trey's soft side as well."
She was going to get some answers.
She came to bed armed with love.
She went to sleep hoping her male had sufficient postage to deliver his package into her box.
"Back at the hotel, Samantha was waiting for a delivery of her own."
"Once again, the leaves bloomed forth Some headed south, some headed north"
"Blue as a baby bird Winged and aloft My eyes search your eyes For something I've lost Samantha, I was thinking."
How about I move to New York?
"I could pursue my two passions, poetry and porn."
We could keep seeing each other.
"Having a fling in LA is one thing, but introducing Mr."
Dildo to everyone at a gala at the Met was quite another.
I don't think it would work.
I'm much too possessive a woman to share your penis with the world.
"Just like that, Samantha escaped a life as Mrs."
She moved Garth out of her present and into her past.
But she took the best part of him with her.
I had finally found a place to escape Miranda's snoring.
The ghosts of my relationships past weren't so easy to shake.
I hadn't really moved on from Big and Aidan.
"No, I was wondering if I could bum one."
"Sorry, it was my last one."
Are you sure you wanna be alone?
"As soon as I said it out loud, I knew that that was what I wanted and needed."
Charlotte woke up as excited as a little girl on Christmas morning.
She couldn't wait to see if Trey's package was unwrapped.
What are you so excited about?
"For the first time in weeks, Charlotte felt relieved."
"Then she realized, if it wasn't physical, she couldn't escape that it might be emotional."
There was no easy love stamp solution to fix that.
I am totally digging this scene.
All the great places in LA and we're at the Saddle Ranch Chop House?
"Don't complain, it's the closest bar without a hill involved."
This is what I'm talking about.
I wish I could be more like that.
"OK, which lovely lady is gonna be next?"
"We weren't sure if it was the climate or the five beers she drank, but as soon as she got on that bull, Miranda escaped Miranda."
"Wow, I can see she really did need a vacation."
"The next day, as I pulled up to the studio, I realized, I was the one who held the key to my escape."
"I could go in and have someone tell me the mistakes I'd made in my past, or I could drive on and figure them out myself."
"If I could master a stick shift, could a successful relationship be that far behind?"
"LA land of perpetual sun and sunbathing, which also makes it Iand of the perpetual bikini wax."
"After a week, I made an appointment with the city's waxer to the stars Alicia."
"She was known for her artful work, her lightning quick hands and her indecipherable accent."
Why didn't you tell her to stop?
I feel like one of those hairless dogs.
LA men are too lazy to search for anything.
You can't hide your light under a bush.
"Didn't she leave a triangle, a landing strip?"
"No, I am totally bald and freezing."
I'm so aware of down there now.
I feel like I'm nothing but walking sex.
The Brazilian makes you do crazy things.
Be careful who you invite to Brazil.
He doesn't work for him any more.
He's writing that New York sitcom.
The one about the kids who live in a loft.
What are you and Lew gonna do?
We'll have drinks and bitch about LA.
I can't believe he lives here now.
Tell him to move to Brazil.
We'll go to that movie premiere.
"Oh, no one sees the movie."
We'll use my press pass and get into the after party.
You two should get out of the sun.
Lew asked Miranda to meet him at The Flowing Tree.
"Surrounded by all these tanned, fit, happy people, she knew she would recognize pale, chubby, unhappy Lew immediately."
Good thing you still wear that hat.
If you ever see me in a Lakers hat
The sight of all these bleached teeth is blinding.
This place is known for its green tea infusions.
"Take off that hat, I'm gonna shoot you right now."
Where's the guy I shared beers with and made fun of happy people?
"The thing is, I think I'm one of those happy people now."
I was supremely unhappy in NewYork.
"I came here, and I let a lot of that old toxic anger go."
"I take things slowly, get outside LA agrees with me."
"Miranda realized, she was the one standing out."
She was the only angry New Yorker for miles.
"Later that night, two very happy New Yorkers prepared to hike up their first LA red carpet."
Press room is to the left.
"Crinkle cut cheese and fat reporters, I don't think so."
Let me see your movie passes.
No one goes to the movie.
Could you step off the red carpet?
Do you know who she is?
No one goes to the movie.
"There I was, a Hollywood nobody, cast off the red carpet and standing in my proper place on a parking lot."
"Tell her that when she's ready to deal, she can call me herself."
Please tell me you have another one.
I thought I had a problem.
I thought they'd banned these here.
I taped them to my body on the plane.
Too pretty to be a writer.
That's too cheesy for you to be a writer.
It will take an hour to get the car.
"Let's go inside, just enjoy our evening."
"Once we got inside, our magic carpet ride really began."
I can't believe they wouldn't let you in.
You're gonna ride me with that.
"Someone's ass is ringing, and it ain't mine."
"Excuse me, I'll just be one second."
That is one tall drink ofwater.
She had worshipped Hugh Hefner since she was old enough to steal her father's Playboys.
"In that case, join us for a drink."
Drinking with three blondes I guess that's a regular day for you.
"I'm pretty crazed this week, but I have an opening on Wednesday."
I had been trying to get into Linc for a week.
"He seemed smart and sexy, and this outsider liked being inside."
Do you want to go there?
"Yeah, I want to go to the VlP room."
"Back home, Charlotte had never felt more inside."
She had just attended her first black tie doctors' benefit.
We make a fine looking couple.
"Mrs MacDougal, you did quite well."
"You know, doctor, I have an itch."
Could you help me out with it?
"Maybe it's time we thought about some options, like Viagra."
Are you aware that Viagra is a killer for men with heart problems?
My father died of a heart attack.
Trey wasn't the only one with heart problems.
It was the fifth time he'd gone running at bedtime in the last two weeks.
"The next day, Samantha decided to get some exercise as well."
Her pocketbook was getting most of the workout.
She decided to give her old pocketbook a rest.
"As Charlotte picked up my mail, she realized she missed more than her sex life."
"If Trey could run away from their problems, so could she."
And I really missed you guys.
He refuses to even talk about it.
I take it you'll be staying?
You came to the right place.
I gotta meet this Keith guy.
Miranda and Samantha are down by the pool.
"Charlotte glanced at the glistening pool, and just like that, her marriage and Trey seemed far away."
"Before lunch, I agreed to go with Keith to see a house he was interested in."
"In New York, a first date is dinner and a movie."
"In LA, it's lunch and seeing a"
But does a single guy like you need this much space?
"But come on, it looks good."
"In the South American's living room, my Brazilian made me kiss him."
Wait till you see the hot tub.
We should check out the hot tub.
"I'll have the omelet with no cheese, but tomatoes and mushrooms."
"Instead of the fries a side of fruit with no grapes, and a half decaf skim."
You should get the mushrooms steamed.
It lightens the calories but retains the flavor.
Keith wants a million house and I can't afford new curtains.
That's where the guys here have New York men beat real estate.
Lew may be the perfect guy.
He's an ideal combination of the two coasts.
"He's a New Yorker at heart, but he's lost all his neuroses and pounds."
Aren't we supposed to like neurotic guys?
The Woody Allen thing is so over
One woman's pornographer is another woman's spiritual leader.
Maybe it's time I stopped being angry.
How would you spend your time?
I'll tell you what you could do.
You'd never know it wasn't real unless you looked at the lining.
All my insides are on the outside now.
All that matters is what it looks like.
He lives in the Valley .
I am so happy to be out of that condom stage of life.
I thought it was called my thirties .
It's nice to go to bed with the same man every night.
Tell me you didn't come to LA to tell us how much sex you're having.
Charlotte couldn't tell them her conjugal bliss was a conjugal miss.
What should I do first in LA?
The first thing you'll need is a good bikini wax.
"That night, after hours of pool time, I realized something startling."
I was actually starting to like LA.
"New Yorkers are trained to hate Los Angeles, where, supposedly, intellect is ridiculed and who you date and what you look like is revered."
"Yet, we were having the time of our lives."
"The men were happy, the homes were huge, the bags looked great."
The weather moves from west to east.
Was it a just matter of time before the truth blew across Manhattan?
"When it comes to bags, men and cities, is it really what's outside that counts?"
"The next day, Samantha and l went to the Valley for Fendi bags."
Is that an address or a zip code?
He should work on his display area.
"But staring into the trunk, they didn't look elegant."
"Even if everyone else thought it was real, I'd always know, my bag came from a trunk deep in the Valley."
You don't want a bag now?
"Please, don't smoke near the bags."
We drove for two hours in the Valley
I'm going back to the hotel.
They looked so sad staring up at me from that trunk.
They were waiting to be adopted.
I was almost eaten by dogs.
The least you could've done was buy a bag.
It's better to wait for the real thing.
Then at least you know it's special.
My marriage is a fake Fendi.
"Trey and I look like the perfect couple from the outside, but on the inside it's all fake."
She told me at the wedding.
You'd just say you'd told me so and I shouldn't have married so quickly.
Who am I to judge you?
We all have our own paths in life.
Three days with Lew had changed Miranda from deeply sarcastic to Deepak Chopra.
I know how to cheer you up.
A trip to the Playboy mansion.
Hef invited us for one of those Playmate pool parties.
Why would that cheer her up?
Does she look like a frat boy?
"No, but it wouldn't hurt to meet some."
"Come on, it would be fun."
"All right, fine, but I better be on the guest list."
"Later that night, I was a guest at Keith's amazing house."
"He made sizzling scallops, and after dinner things got even hotter."
NewYork should have more hot tubs like on roofs and stuff.
"While I was going native with Keith, Miranda and Lew went to New York."
At least to the New York strip steak.
"God, do I miss this smell"
Read Zen And The Art Of Modern Living .
I'm still trying to get used to bath beans.
"Come on, don't you miss it?"
"No, I write about it every day."
"That's not New York, it's a sound stage."
somethings with tiny salaries don't live in SoHo lofts.
I think million viewers would disagree with you on that one.
Is something wrong with your steak?
You think I look this good by eating?
"Lew hadn't found inner peace, he'd found an eating disorder."
Don't put your toxic shit on me.
You have no idea what pressure I'm under.
Who cares what you look like.
No one wants to hire a fat story editor.
Miranda wanted to rip that Knicks hat off his head.
No self respecting New Yorker would spit out that good a steak.
"Waking up in Keith's sun filled bedroom, I felt like"
I like what you have going on down there.
That would be a whole lot of nothing.
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
"I told you, no prostitutes when you're house sitting."
I thought you were an agent.
My agent won't water my plants.
"The life I was coveting wasn't Keith's, it was Carrie Fisher's."
Am I going to have to return her car?
Are you going to bring prostitutes to Ben's new million home?
I have a column in New York.
Have you been smoking in here?
"The dry cleaning and the cat food, that's all done."
It was the perfect ending to my week of make believe a visit to the Playboy mansion and the Playmate pool party.
Could our lives get any weirder?
"In LA, house sitters are somebodies and writers are prostitutes."
You're at least a high class escort.
"After the sun went down, the party really started heating up."
Where are the girls in the satin outfits and the Bunny ears?
"Yeah, I want to see some Bunny ears."
"Somewhere between the ltalian grotto and the petting zoo, Charlotte found something real."
The colors in his pool series are so LA.
The blues and those deep greens.
"God, it is such a pleasure talking to an intelligent woman for once."
I love talking to you too.
It's nice to be with a man who talks.
I guess that third welcome drink has finally kicked in?
I'm lying here with a man I hardly know.
Let me buy you some boobs.
Charlotte had forgotten how awful single life could be.
"Marriage, with all its problems, wasn't looking so bad."
"When I got up, it was gone."
"Oh my God, that Bunny's got my bag."
A label that says Made in China and there's a bunch of condoms in there.
She thought everything on the Bunny was fake.
"Apparently, one nod from Hef, and the pool party was over."
I'm not leaving without my friends.
"The fake Fendi ended up costing for the bag, unspecified costs to Samantha's ego."
And Miranda and I took a wrong turn on the way to the buffet.
"The next day, four New Yorkers left LA a little lighter."
"Some of us had lost our hair, and all of us had lost a little dignity."
Samantha couldn't wait to get back to the crime free streets of Manhattan.
Miranda couldn't wait to get back to men who swallowed.
Charlotte couldn't wait to get back to Trey.
"And as for me, I couldn't wait."
"Six hours later, I was home."
"It looked even better on the inside than I remembered it, because inside it was all real."
I was starting to feel like myself again.
The rest of me would grow back eventually.
"If you live in NewYork for ten years, you can call yourself a New Yorker."
But the trained eye can always spot the ones who were born here.
"I want it all, I want it now, and I want you to get it for me."
"After firing her last two publicists, Jenny Brier, the daughter of a restaurateur, had decided that Samantha would take over the PR for her upcoming party."
"I want Vanity Fair , Carson Daly, People , Teen People , NSYNC"
"Don't take this the wrong way, but how old are you?"
"Just like that, the meeting was over."
"I'm sorry, I don't do kids' parties."
"Sweetie, my father has invited over of his powerful friends."
I told Daddy we'll be lucky if we can swing this for under a mill.
"After meeting her new client, Samantha met us for the latest trend in power lunching haute cafeteria cuisine."
"Coming in for a landing, sister?"
Thought he was checking me out for a second.
"Looking at you looking at him, like I asked you not to."
This isn't PS we're adults now.
We have to at least pretend to know better.
I saw a doctor about my headaches.
I've been trying to diagnose myself on the lnternet.
Type in your symptoms and wait for the word cancer to appear.
"Anyway, turns out I'm a tongue thruster."
"If you were a man, that would be a good thing."
"My tongue pushes against my teeth, so my bite is all off."
My dentist thinks I have TMJ.
"No, I mean he's really cute."
She could write him a note.
"Guys, I'm not writing him a note."
I'm not giving him my number.
"I'm sorry to bother you, but my friend Miranda over there"
Please tell your friend Miranda to call me.
"On the way home, I decided to brave the afternoon heat to see if my shoe repair guy could do anything about my old soles."
"But when I got there, there was no there there."
He fixed these the last time.
He couldn't afford the place once they destabilized the rent.
"If the comic business keeps going the way it is, I won't be able to either."
"He's a superhero, or he wants to be."
He's trying to find his super powers.
Turn to page seven of your newspaper.
"Yes, I thought you looked familiar."
Would you like to write comics?
"There are women superheroes Batgirl, Supergirl, Black Canary You've heard ofWonder Woman."
With the bracelets and the tiara.
I used to love that even her accessories had super powers.
"To them, you are Wonder Woman."
I never did get my shoes fixed.
"But the next week, I got new boots."
"I don't know what came over me, but I felt compelled to thank him."
"Even as a superhero, I was powerless to resist."
"That evening, inspired by Miranda's digital diagnosis, Charlotte went surfing for a cure for Trey's condition."
"There it was, in both the on and off positions."
worth of hydraulics that could turn Trey into the Bionic Man.
"Ordinarily, this was something Charlotte would shy away from, but since her marriage was shy of wood That night, I met Wade Adams alias Power Lad at Bar Code, a Times Square bar that specialized in real drinks and virtual reality."
"I can't believe this place, it's like ten bucks a game."
"Yeah, but games come with beer."
They want you to play half as well and twice as much.
What will it be Bloodburst or Terrorfright ll?
Whatever happened to Frogger and Miss Pacman?
"I don't know, but wanna go to Mars?"
"Without leaving the building, Power Lad took me to the furthest reaches of the galaxy and right back to seventh grade."
"Bram and Pippin liked the 'Lafite, which was entirely acceptable."
The implant's onoff switch had Charlotte thinking about Trey's.
"She was desperate to turn his on, but didn't know where to find it."
I went to the gallery in the morning and the framer's in the afternoon.
Then I found this on the lnternet.
Just that We've tried everything else and we still You haven'tin myever So I thought
What other options do we have?
"Five beers, four video games, degrees outside later"
"Besides, all the kids got them."
I'm not the kind of girl who scoots to a guy's terrace on the first date.
"You said you had a view, not the view."
And this breeze it's like there's different air up here.
How do you have all this?
Why don't I get us some beers?
Then we can talk adventures and real estate.
How was it possible that mild mannered Power Lad had a classic six on the Upper East Side with a view of the park?
Was he Power Lad by day and a millionaire playboy by night?
"Carrie, I'd like you to meet my mother."
"It's a beautiful night, isn't it?"
"But don't stay up too late, dear."
"Lovely to meet you too, Mrs."
"The next day at Commune, daddy Brier's latest restaurant, I asked Samantha about my prospects with Power Lad."
He put his money in the comic book store.
He's saving up for his own place.
You know howtough the market is.
There's no way you'd go out with a guy who lived with his family?
I have to wear them for a year.
"No, they don't look so bad."
I'm in pain looking at you.
"I'm a year old with braces, and I'm on a liquid diet."
Pain doesn't begin to cover it.
A year old girl just bought us a bottle of Dom Perignon?
Do you knowwhat I was buying when I was
I served Dilly Bars at Dairy Queen.
Where is that Brat Mitzvah beast?
"Your column about secret sex hello, my life."
"My ex was so completely about the sex when we were alone, but at school, I didn't exist."
"I'm sorry, are your braces blue?"
You have the old fashioned kind.
I didn't knowthey still made those.
"Were Jenny Brier and her friends dressed like something year olds, or were we trying to look like teenagers?"
"One was sending Dom Perignon, another was touring on a scooter."
"When you're a teenager, all you want to do is buy beer."
Once you hit all you want to do is get carded.
"I wondered, in today's youth obsessed culture, are the women of my generation growing into responsible adults, or are we going on"
"After a week of self imposed seclusion, Miranda felt strong enough for solid food and table service with Lance Bloom, a senior editor at Knopf."
"I started out wanting to be a writer, but it's a solitary life."
What are you working on now?
They're going to take some getting used to.
What's it like to kiss somebody with those things?
The doctor said it should be fine.
"But a blow job is out of the question, right?"
He didn't want your hardware getting too close to his software.
I can't open my mouth without the world thinking I'm a freak.
It's like I'm back in Junior High.
I was lucky I got out alive the first time.
Think of it as mouth jewelry.
If the guy's worth dating he won't care about your braces.
That was so After School Special of you.
"In the After School Special, you'd see him across the cafeteria."
"He'd smile, and he'd have braces too."
"But the sick thing is, I would never date a guy with braces."
"How about some nice, homemade Toll House cookies?"
"On closer inspection, living with the parents wasn't so bad."
It was like having servants you didn't have to pay.
"Oh, and Carrie, can you stay for dinner?"
"Faced with having hydraulic cylinders placed in his shaft, Trey decided to pursue the less physically demanding option of counseling with a therapist he'd found through his college alumni."
I sense you're both having difficulty verbalizing your sexual issues.
With some clients it often helps to create your own non threatening language with which to talk about sex.
I'm not sure that I understand.
One client rather whimsically dubbed his anus The Chocolate Starfish.
Are you sure you went to Yale?
"Charlotte, if you could rename your vagina, something non sexual, something that didn't feel threatening to you or Trey, what would you call it?"
"It sounds nice, and I've always liked the name."
"There's still a lot of work ahead, some here and some at home."
"Tonight, as homework, I want you to lie down together, side by side, without touching, and share a sexual fantasy."
I'm a fairy princess in a forest.
Suddenly I see a pirate in buckskins.
That's when you pull me off my unicorn.
"You tear away my gossamer petticoats, and you put your Schooner deep inside my Rebecca."
We've dealt with this for weeks.
I'm not that sexual a person.
But we love each other and we're married now.
"That night, Wade and l had our first sleep over, at my place."
I finally figured out what made Power Lad so powerful.
He had the soul of a teenage boy in the body of a very grown up man.
'We never heard from Wade about whether he fed the dog his medicine.
"Wade's father was just about to give it to the dog, 'but if he's already had it, that would be bad."
"lf you speak to Wade, please tell him, 'l won't go to bed until I hear from him."
"Yes, Mom, I gave the dog his medicine."
"No, Mom, I'm not mad, I just I told you not to call me here."
She wants to talk to you.
"Several blocks south, Charlotte's night was interrupted too by odd noises coming from her bathroom."
She hadn't meant to make Trey cry.
He said he wasn't a sexual person.
"This may be difficult, Trey, but I want you to tell me specifically which magazine you were using."
We can try and see this as a positive thing.
How is this a positive thing?
At least we know he isn't gay.
"Excuse me, what exactly is the problem here?"
"It was tension release, it had nothing to do with my wife."
We have to find a way to integrate your wife into your sexual routine.
How are we supposed to do that?
She wished they were before sex had made everything so complicated.
When holding hands and a kiss would have been all she needed.
"To pierce the corporate veil, the courts look at five factors whether the subsidiary is wholly owned or"
"The year old girl inside Miranda wanted to disappear, but the year old partner in this firm decided she wasn't going anywhere."
You think it's hilarious that I have braces?
Let's take a moment and have a good laugh.
Let's get it out of our systems so we can work like adults.
We were laughing at the typo on page three.
Miranda decided that TMJ was less painful than a second adolescence.
"The next day, she had her braces removed and resumed her life as a year old tongue thruster."
Trey resumed his own brand of thrusting and discovered that tension release could be a turn on.
Charlotte discovered a way to include herself in Trey's sex life.
And she figured out what to do with those proofs not suitable for framing.
The following weekend at the Brier Bar Mitzvah party I'm not sure if I have your name.
I'm not sure if I have your name.
"Let's see, Goldman, Goldstein I don't see it."
I'm sure I'm on the list.
I can't believe you still have actual albums.
This song is me driving my parents' Oldsmobile without them knowing.
You knowwhat would go with this?.
Six times stronger than pot and bucks an ounce.
It was obvious Wade was in no hurry to save up for his own apartment.
"I hadn't smoked pot out of a bong since my eighth grade boyfriend made one out of tin foil, a BlC pen, and a bottle of Pepsi Light."
I didn't even know if I'd remember how.
Turns out it was like riding a bike a ten speed.
"Back at the Bar Mitzvah bash, Samantha heard some girl talk not suitable for little ladies."
I'm gonna fuck at least three of those NSYNC guys after the after party.
I'd fuck them and their gay boyfriends.
Aren't you a little young for that kind of talk?
You have your whole lives to talk that way.
"Enjoy being children, at least until you turn and start having sex."
I've given blow jobs since twelve.
It's the only way guys will like you.
Samantha had resented Jenny Brier because of everything she had.
"But then she realized, she'd had something that no amount of money could buy a childhood."
"Suddenly, the Dairy Queen wasn't looking so bad."
Attack of the spicy chicken wings.
That looks like my parents' car.
"My parents said, if they caught me smoking pot again, I'd have to sleep in the store."
"If they see billions of chicken wings, they're gonna know we've been smoking pot."
Where did we put the fucking pot?
"We told you, if you ever brought marijuana into this house again"
Power Lad would never have ratted me out.
Did you bring marijuana into this house?
There comes a time when you have to take responsibility for yourself.
"A time when l, like Jenny Brier, had to stand up and say to the world, Today, I am a woman."
"Adams, I brought the marijuana into the house."
And I'm taking it with me when I go.
"In the end, I decided I was definitely going on but in a city like New York with its pace and pressures, sometimes it's important to have a year old moment, to remember a simpler time when the best thing in life was hanging out, Iistening to records, and having fun with friends in your own apartment."
"On a city where cynicism is as prevalent as pashmina, there is nothing more hopeful than getting ready for the first date."
Will O'Connor was a cute urban planner Miranda had met at Starbucks.
He mistook her latte for his double caff and offered to make it up to her by buying her a drink that Saturday.
Samantha preferred the saying good night to the first date routine.
"For Sam, it was a very good night."
"Meanwhile, Trey and Charlotte were practicing their new routine."
"All righty, I'm bringing it into the harbor."
"After a week of the same routine, the only thing getting up in their bed was Charlotte's libido."
"As for me, my routine had become very routine."
I was spending almost every night working.
My date is three hours late.
And I'm wearing a new dress.
And I'm eating out of plastic.
The least he could do is get to know me before he rejects me.
This hasn't happened to me since I'm
I thought I'd got smarter about picking them now.
I can't believe guys still stand girls up.
I can't believe I'm eating a frozen dinner.
Do you wanna grab a drink?
"I can't, I have to work."
I agreed to teach these stupid Learning Annex classes.
They're calling it Bright Lights Date City .
It's a seminar on where to meet men.
Tell them to steer clear of Starbucks.
This dress is making a mockery of me.
Stood up at Miranda had done nothing.
At she decided she wasn't going to take this stand up lying down.
Will gave her the cold shoulder and his home number.
"I don't know howyou raised your son, but he just stood me up for a date."
They're starting to die on us.
At least you weren't stood up.
It explains why they don't call back.
This is why I don't work out.
Do you wanna hear the worst part?
"I felt so bad, I told his mother I would go to the wake."
I got us reservations at Samba next week.
I could only get us a four top.
Do you think Trey would mind staying home?
He doesn't seem up for much these days.
"I love him, and he's trying, but this is so frustrating."
"Last night I got so turned on, l"
"You almost masturbated, he almost got it up you almost had sex."
That's why I got your voicemail.
"When it comes to me, nothing."
"Trey sees you as his virginal wife, not as sexual plaything."
You're not going to get anywhere until you change how he sees you.
I don't know if I can do that.
I soon realized how many desperate New York women there were.
I'm flattered that so many of you showed up to hear me talk.
"The fact is, I have had a lot of experience with men."
"Some of it good, some of it bad, some of it very ugly."
There are two million single men in this city.
I have dated about a million of them.
All these men are right outside your door.
"Next time you step out with your shoes and traveling cappuccino, take a look around."
Our metropolis is stacked with men.
You never knowwho you'll run into.
"You can turn a corner, and boom bright lights, date city."
Do you mean places to meet men?
Any sporting Sports bars Mickey Mantle's.
I once met this fellow on the Hampton Jitney.
"It turned out he couldn't drive, and he was on a parole program."
"Suddenly, I felt like the bad example."
"No, not that I'm aware of."
I'm really not an expert on men.
I just write about this stuff.
Then why are we paying to hear you talk about it?
The only thing I learned that night was that I should have stayed home.
"If you stay single long enough, you should get wiser about dating."
"Which men, where to meet them But what made us experts?"
Wasn't our single status a neon sign that we couldn't get it right?
"What if all these years in New York have only made us older, more confused or dead?"
Are we getting wiser or just older?
"If they'd been holding tomatoes not Louis Vuitton bags, I'd be dead."
Do you know there are no free men?
"We're at my date's wake, so yes"
What do I know about men.
All I have is a bunch of failed relationships.
As if being dead person adjacent isn't bad enough.
I'm supposed to teach another class.
What am I going to do?
I've never seen a dead body before.
A place to meet men an after wake party.
He had money set aside for this.
I like him even more now.
He was so organized he had a will.
This place is full of men.
They know any minute they're out of here.
I cut it for a real job.
We dated a grillion years ago.
"I'd ask if you're having fun, but that seems inappropriate."
We were always fighting it out for everything.
"He even died first, just to beat me to the punch."
That's what I thought when I dated him.
"When it wasn't working, and I broke up with him, Hello, asshole."
"Snide comments, rumor spreading, the works."
"I would love to chat inappropriately, but I'm due to give a toast."
So this is a working wake for you.
I'd love to get together with you sometime.
"My e mail address is on the back, and my cell."
Will's death had turned Miranda into my target audience a desperate woman.
"Downtown, Samantha was getting wise, Sebastian Wise, again."
"While, uptown, Charlotte was getting nothing at all."
Does he go to Mickey Mantle's?
He made me come six times.
Why do you always talk about sex like that?
"Simmer down, mommy hasn't had her caffeine yet."
I can't take this any more.
Sex is something special between two people who love each other.
Or two people who love sex.
You can't just sleep with everything that comes along.
"Softie, at least I'm getting laid."
She needs the stick out of her ass and a dick in her coochie pronto.
Maybe you should forget Samba too.
I'm staying way out of this one.
"Speaking of petty, how upset would you be if I went out with Jim?"
He needs to be voted off the island.
"I know how you feel, but he was so sweet on the phone."
He's alive and he asked me out.
One woman's asshole is another woman's
As long as you're OK with it.
"Later that week, Charlotte decided for Trey to see the sexual part of her, she'd have to dress the part."
I'm going to get him to notice me.
"If you're going to go the lingerie route, why not go a little more upscale and less flammable?"
I want to be call girl meets Park Avenue.
Then you have to pair that with a cardigan.
I need him to see me sexually.
I'm just not sure I need to.
This is much more a Samantha job.
I need a break from her.
You shouldn't be so hard on her.
She doesn't mean to be hurtful.
There were two of you ruining my breakfast.
I have enough problems right now.
It was my second lecture that week that was a failure.
"Across town, Samantha decided the wise thing to do was to take a break from all of us and go shopping."
"Let it go, no one gets hurt."
Don't let the southern accent fool you.
I'll let you have this scarf if you show me where a girl can get a hard drink in a dark bar around here.
The fact that you're still breathing makes this a success.
Carrie wasn't sure that we would get along.
She knew me a long time ago.
"Back then, I was in a band called Uncle Ted's Ass."
And I could sit on my hair.
I'd like to see you again.
"The next morning, Miranda called with the post mortem on her date with Jim."
I thought it was the Learning Annex bugging me about my class.
People asked for refunds after my first class.
I feel like a total sham.
That's my friend you're talking about.
"Don't make me say, l told you so."
We talked till the restaurant closed.
Are we talking about Asshole Jim?
Not till you break up with him.
He says great things about you.
I'm going out with him on Friday.
I feel weird dating a guy that you don't like.
We should all go out have a drink sometime.
What do you know about this guy?
"Charlotte decided this would be a good time to spend with old friends, the sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma."
Has it been forever or what?
Welcome to the married old girls club.
"I would like to trade my husband in for him, please."
"After all, they were married too."
I remember being a newly wed.
We hardly ever got out of bed.
My husband can't get it up.
It would have been wiser to have a cappuccino instead of a third drink.
Don't you ever just want to be pounded hard?
"Like when the bed is moving all around, and it's all sweaty, your head is knocking the headboard and you feel it might blow off?"
"Dammit, I just really want to be fucked."
The only heads blowing off were those of Kappa Kappa Grandma.
Charlotte realized how much they'd all changed since college.
"And to them, she had become Samantha."
Would you like to join me at Samba on Friday night?
Two hot broads at a hot restaurant.
Samantha couldn't believe how much fun she was having.
She had found a woman who was as open about her sexuality as her.
I could just eat you up.
Samantha learned she had a little Charlotte in her.
She had a line that could be crossed.
Hers was just more to the left.
"The next night, I agreed to meet Jim and Miranda for drinks."
Jim took me to a poetry reading last night.
The unpublished works of Robert Lowell.
He wrote his thesis on Lowell.
There's a lot you never knew.
"I lost track of you, but I always read your column."
There's a lot of sex in there.
You didn't knowtoo much about sex when we were dating.
Did you ever hear his band play?
She was busy shopping for shoes.
They come in handy when you're walking all over people.
Carrie doesn't walk all over people.
Maybe that's because you're an asshole.
She never called me once after we broke up.
Are you breaking up with me?
"The fancy lawyer lady is breaking up with me, like I give a shit."
Jim hadn't gotten older or wiser.
"Once dumped, he'd still dumped on everyone."
Is it bad that it makes me feel good to say that?
I can't believe I fell for that asshole.
There are plenty of other assholes out there.
"Meanwhile, uptown, the Samantha in Charlotte was ready to come out."
What in God's name are you wearing?
"I'm not a madonna, and I'm not a whore."
I'm sexual and I love you.
I can I can see that.
I think we have a stiff breeze.
"That night, Trey successfully screwed his wife for a full minute and a half before the wind died."
"After Charlotte's night of love, she called the one person she knew who would appreciate it the most."
I knew you could do it.
"Having spent time with their frenemies, they forgot they were enemies and went back to being friends."
I realized I had become my own worst frenemy.
I had let desperate women and one asshole convince me that I didn't know anything.
I decided to keep my second date with the Learning Annex.
"Unfortunately, my reputation had preceded me."
You've paid good money to find out how to meet men.
"I don't know a lot about it, but you're not going to meet them in a Learning Annex class."
"Come on, we're not getting any younger."
Just trying to give you your money's worth.
"I took them to a bar, took my and bought them drinks."
"Anne, the guy over there is checking you out."
Go and ask him for a light.
"OK, one down, five to go."
"That night, I made three matches."
I try not to date while at work.
"The old and wise adage is true those who can't do, teach."
"Two months into her marriage, Charlotte's life seemed to be a bed of roses."
That's what it looked like to an onlooker.
My boys have been playing each other since prep school.
They're still not tired of it.
We can make an exception this one time.
Your father would roll over in his grave if he heard you.
Charlotte hasn't been issued a copy of the MacDougal house rules.
"No, but it's time I got one."
"It's next to the Bible, on your bed stand."
Tradition is a very undervalued virtue.
Marrying a MacDougal is marrying history.
I guess I better go change.
Charlotte had no interest in hearing any more about the family history.
Her history with Trey was depressing enough.
"After a few half baked attempts at a sex life, Trey seemed to give up."
The only place he even tried to score was on the tennis court.
He had the most intoxicating scent.
"Like sweat mixed with something, something sweet yet pungent."
Does he water plants in Manhattan?
I can't be looking at gardeners.
"Why be in the suburbs, if you're not gonna fuck a gardener?"
He was so tanned and muscular.
The sweat ran down from his chest onto his perfectly defined stomach.
"You read Harlequin Romances in school, haunts you forever."
"Whatever you do, don't look up."
"Oh, my God, did you see the way she looked at me?"
Did you see the look her friend shot us?
"Contempt, like I was Pol Pot."
Who does she think she is?
I can't believe that there is a person in New York who could hate me that much.
I was so devastated by Natasha's withering look that I decided my only recourse was to go shopping.
"I took a wrong turn looking for the right shoes, and south of Houston Street I literally lost my direction."
"Excuse me, I knowthis sounds ridiculous."
Can you tell me which way is West Broadway?
"and when the city was getting safe, I got mugged."
"Please, sir, they're my favorite pair."
I got them half price at a sample sale.
"Somebody stop him, he took my strappy sandals."
"He said, Give me your Blahniks , which I thought was a joke."
Then I'm barefoot on a sidewalk in the middle of summer.
"Anything other than the watch, the bag, the ring, and the shoes?"
I can't believe he took your shoes.
You only get that from pork.
I'm sure I stepped on a piece of it somewhere.
"Detective Stevens, this is my friend, my lawyer, Miranda Hobbes."
Any chance of catching this guy?
Maybe you can come with me and read him his Miranda rights.
Anybody can be lrish with the right colorist.
"A sense of humor, I like that in a lawyer."
I'll get back to you as soon as I have something.
"I get mugged, and you get him?"
The man was smitten with you.
He probably wants free legal advice.
Samantha discovered that her number had been passed around as well.
This is a message for Sam Jones.
"If you're getting this, it's Brian."
"You don't know me, but I'll be there tomorrowwith some party favorites."
The Sam Jones who's having the big party tomorrow night?
Exactly who is this Sam Jones?
And where is this fabulous party?
Miranda had a date with my detective
The most gorgeous man I've met is in my living room.
I can't figure out what to wear.
"Shut your eyes, and go with your first instinct."
I've been in here for minutes.
By now he thinks I'm a freak.
What are you so worked up about?
He's too good looking for me.
I don't have outfits that go with Hunk.
"Maybe after years of odd men, the universe is throwing me a bone."
"If you're lucky, a boner as well."
"Tell Detective Stevens, if he sees a woman wearing pink suede Blahnik sandals, bring her in for questioning."
"While I ascribed thoughts of karma to fortune cookie psychology, I wondered, does a string of bad dates equal one good one?"
And will treating someone badly in one relationship ensure that you'll be treated badly in the next?
Does everything that goes around come around?
"If so, will it come around to bite you in the ass?"
Is there such a thing as relationship karma?
"Later, I accompanied Samantha to a party thrown by Sam Jones."
I can't believe we're going to the party of a total stranger.
"It's not a total stranger, we do share the same name."
Why are you walking so slow?
I keep waiting for someone to jump out and steal my bra.
"If the guy's a loser, I'll tell him to stop having his friends call me, and we'll go for dinner."
How can you tell over the phone?
"Besides, Washington Square very money address."
I feel like there's some cosmic purpose to all this.
It's too much of a coincidence.
What was the cosmic purpose of my getting snubbed by Natasha?
"If I told you I had information about Big and Natasha, would you consider it cosmic or a random act of gossip?"
I'd have to hear it first.
She's back working for Ralph Lauren.
A little bird I fucked at Ralph Lauren.
You waited blocks to tell me that?.
I wanted you to have fun
I can't believe I'm responsible for breaking up their marriage.
It probably wouldn't have worked anyway.
I don't think I could feel any worse.
"Look at that, I feel worse."
Do you think these cute boys are still in college?
"I'm going to find Sam Jones, and then we're outta here."
Could you tell me where I can find Sam Jones?
It appears that we have a problem here.
"We have the same name, and I'm getting all your fucking calls."
"If you're getting all my fucking calls, that explains why I'm still a virgin."
"Samantha wondered what message the universe was sending her, but Miranda had no doubt."
"This was fun, and I would invite you in, but you've been in, and I have a huge day tomorrow, which isn't to say I wouldn't like to see you again."
"I would, if you'd like I'll call you."
She felt like she had just hit the cosmic jackpot.
Please don't tell anyone we were here.
Some of those boys were cute.
Some of them were young enough
"Natasha fell down the stairs, now I fall down the stairs."
This is an open and shut case of karmic retribution.
"Yesterday, I get mugged, now I can't even get a taxi and I can always get a taxi."
"If everything happens for a reason, why am I getting calls for Sam Jones?"
I only know about my own karma.
I only know about my own karma.
Maybe I should fuck that virgin and give him the great first time experience that I never had.
"That's not karma, that's statutory rape."
"Across town, Charlotte was getting a message of her own."
"Later that week, my knee still hurting from my trip down the stairs, I decided to take matters into my own hands."
"I'd like to speak to Natasha, please."
I didn't know howto tell an assistant it was of cosmic significance.
"I don't mean to be rude, but you'll be holding forever."
I had tough karma to overcome.
"The next week, Charlotte flirted with her own karma."
Where did you get such a green thumb?
A special hybrid of American Beauty.
Charlotte's karma flirted back in a most unexpected way.
Samantha was working out some karmic issues of her own.
I came over to apologize for all those calls.
I've been waiting for a woman like you my whole life.
You are the hottest thing I've ever seen.
Goodbye to the sweetest lips I've ever kissed.
"Later, the MacDougals were enjoying their cocktail hour, which generally lasted from m to last man standing."
I beat you three sets in a row.
It was getting dark as you recall.
I certainly had an interesting day.
"In the afternoon, I took a walk around the property and saw Charlotte kissing the gardener."
Samantha found that the universe had sent her many messages.
I can't stop thinking about you.
I have to see you tonight.
"I don't think I can live without you, OK?"
I have to see you tonight.
"Across town, Miranda met her karmic treasure for dinner."
"After ten years, I made partner two months ago."
Can I get you another drink?
I loved Columbo so much as a kid
Miranda realized that every woman was staring at her date.
Your friend is the typical case that I see on the job.
It's not as exciting as you might think.
She knewwhat they were thinking why is that attractive man with her?
"If your friend hadn't lost her shoes, I wouldn't be here."
She drank to feel better about herself.
"Six vodka martinis later, she was feeling pretty damn good."
You may be the most beautiful man that I've ever been with.
"I'm no Mena Suvari, but I'm great in bed."
"When Trey didn't come to bed, Charlotte went looking for him."
What are you doing out here?
"You're upset, and what I did was so wrong."
"I'm unable to meet your needs, so from time to time, as much as I detest it, I'll have to look the other way."
I don't want a husband who looks the other way.
I want a husband who makes me not want to kiss the gardener.
So much of what we have is wonderful.
We can have separate lives and still be together.
"As Charlotte looked at her perfect husband at their family's perfect country house, she realized the one thing that was missing was that perfect connection with an imperfect person."
"When we get back to the city, I think we should separate for a while."
"Seven unreturned phone calls, and still no response from Natasha."
Buddhists believe you pay for what you do wrong in this life in the next.
I just didn't think I could wait a lifetime to be forgiven.
"The next morning, Miranda woke up with the worst hangover of her life."
"On her hall table, she discovered that Detective Stevens had left a number for her local AA chapter."
"In screwing Sam Jones, she wound up screwing herself."
"A few days later, Charlotte came home to her old apartment."
"It was good fortune that she had only sublet it, not to mention good sense."
"Not wanting to come back in my next life as a dung beetle, I asked Samantha's assistant to pump Natasha's assistant to find out where she was having lunch."
I need to talk to you.
I'm only gonna stay a minute.
"I tried to call you at work, but Anyway, it's not important."
Can I have a sip of this?
I never meant for any of this to happen.
"If there was something I could do to take it away, I would."
I came here today because I needed to say how sorry I am.
I am deeply sorry for what I did to you.
I'm sorry he moved to Paris and fell in love with me.
I'm sorry that we ever got married.
"I'm sorry he cheated on me with you, and I'm sorry that I pretended to ignore it for as long as I did."
"I'm sorry I found you in my apartment, fell down the stairs and broke my tooth."
I'm very sorry that after much painful dental surgery this tooth is still a different color than this tooth.
"Finally, I'm sorry that you felt the need to come down here."
"Not only have you ruined my marriage, you've ruined my lunch."
That's just what I had to say.
My actions had set into motion a karmic chain of events that put Natasha back on the singles market.
As if single women didn't have it hard enough.
"Somewhere out there, Big was alone again."
"The universe may not always play fair, but at least it's got a hell of a sense of humor."
"In life, there are all sorts of wake up calls."
But crowing on East d Street was one I was not prepared for.
"I'd let my frenzy for a rent controlled apartment near Barneys, override the fact that it was animal hospital adjacent."
That's the thing about New York you never know what's around the corner.
"Or, in Samantha's case, just outside your window."
There they were Samantha's neighborhood transsexual hookers.
"Half man, half woman, totally annoying."
"Girl, she got herself a handful with that one"
He was all up in my stuff once.
I told him to get that thing out of my ass or I'll shit on it.
"Get that out my ass, or I'll shit on it."
Is that the dirtiest thing you've ever heard?
I am paying to live in a neighborhood that's trendy by day and tranny by night.
"Boobs on top, balls down below."
I don't get the appeal there.
"I understand that pseudo straight men have to get laid, but not on my block."
I thought my chickens were bad.
Every morning at m they start.
It's like they're putting on a show.
The Up my ass Players .
It's so weird to be sitting here eating omelet again Iike nothing ever happened.
"It was our first Saturday morning breakfast since Charlotte had left Trey, her husband of three months."
"Sweetie, you're not single you're just separated."
I'll never be single again I'll be divorced.
The only thing worse than being and single is being and divorced.
I think it's worse to be and trapped in a marriage that doesn't work.
"Sweetie, Trey has an impotence problem"
I am so sick of talking about Trey.
I think and talk about Trey all the time.
Talk about the up my ass stuff.
"Sunday, we all come over, have an unpacking party and no Trey talk."
I live around the corner and my window Iooks over the roof with the chickens and the crowing
Rescued from a cockfight in the Bronx.
I'll move them to the basement.
You don't have to do that.
They had all that fight trauma.
I don't want them to be miserable.
They have a very lovely life.
Thank you for being so nice.
Just gonna take one of these for my friend.
I'd like to order some take out.
I'd like to order some chicken with broccoli in a brown
The Chinese take out lady thinks I'm pathetic.
"She said, Every night, the same thing."
That's a tad bitchy for a take out lady.
Do you think I'm in a rut?
"I'm sitting home with my cat, ordering the same thing almost every night."
The only thing sadder would be a Cathy Comic on my refrigerator.
Never say Cathy Comic to me again.
There's This place is my favorite.
It's easier than figuring out where else to go.
Then bear the take out food shame.
What do you think they are talking about?
"Yeah, here's their conversation: How's your dog?"
Was that the bitches who ruined our lives?
We can run the other way or move in here.
Thank God I didn't wear my drawstring pants.
Another thing about New York who knows who is around the corner?
This is what I like about New York.
Did we give you guys a drinking problem?
They are not just for us.
I'll have nightmares about that ladies room for weeks.
"Carrie and Miranda, this is Jessica and Susan."
"Honey, do you still wanna see the movie or just crash?"
"It was good to see you, Aidan."
That night at Charlotte's light unpacking and heavy realisations.
We thought they were pining and they have new girlfriends already
The point is not if they were cute.
"The point is, they were there."
How can they have new relationships?
I'm still in the l just broke up with someone phase.
Women sit around obsessing about what went wrong.
Men just say all righty and move on.
Not all women sit around and obsess about men.
"As soon as my relationships are over, I move on."
I do try to figure out what went wrong.
But I don't think that I obsess.
I still don't know what happened.
You should have a relationship rear view mirror.
Relationships may appear closer than they actually are.
It's much easier for men to move on.
The ratio of women to men in this city is huge.
"They can sit outside, have a beer and wait for the Jessicas and Susans to come to them."
Maybe we only obsess over relationships that feel unfinished.
"I can guarantee that Trey isn't sitting around with his friends, obsessing about what went wrong."
Men never think anything is their fault.
I wish there were no men.
"If there were no men, then we wouldn't feel hurt."
And we wouldn't be spending our night obsessing about them.
"Later that night I got to thinking about men, women and relationships."
"Or more to the point, how women feel men disappoint them in relationships."
"Then a radical, earth shattering thought popped into my head."
What if everything isn't the man's fault?
"After a certain age and a certain number of relationships, if it still isn't working and the ex's seem to be moving on and we don't, perhaps the problem isn't the last boyfriend, or the one before him or even the one before him."
"Could it be that the problem isn't them, but horror of horrors, is it us?"
"Downtown, the Up my ass Players were in the middle of their late night repertory."
Much Ado About Up My Ass and Long Day's Journey Up My Ass .
"Samantha decided if she was gonna get a good night's sleep, she'd have to test how effective a PR professional she was."
"I live right up there, the loft within earshot."
"As much as I respect a woman's right for a little something something with certain New Jersey gentlemen, I have a request."
I have a very early business meeting.
"And I think we all know, there are certain dark circles even the best make up can't cover."
She got the e cut off.
"Those heels are fierce, Miss Girl."
"Samantha knew how to get her way with men, even if they were half women."
"No, I was up late working."
And there are these chickens that crow on the roof next door.
The Fun On The Farm fact everyone's aware of but me.
"So tell me, is red a mistake?"
But I think it's too red.
It's like sleeping in communist China.
I think it was on the news.
I really need to talk to you.
So I'll see you at then.
"Later that day, I met Miranda at my favorite thrift store, to dig for buried treasure."
"Do you think I can get away with a Hang in there, baby halter top?"
"Nobody gets away with a Hang in there, baby halter top."
Do you wanna go to the Hopper exhibit Saturday afternoon?
I'm meeting Big for lunch and I didn't think you'd approve.
He sounded upset and needs to talk.
I'm not holding your hand through this again.
I'm not asking you to hold anything.
"It's not a huge mistake, it's lunch."
How many more times are you gonna go through this?
"Every time you get near him you turn into this pathetic, needy victim."
What pisses me off is that you are more than willing to go back for more.
I am not going back for more and I can't even believe I can't believe you would say that to me.
If you start up with Big again
I am not starting up with Big again.
"If you do, I don't wanna know anything about it."
Are you gonna cut me out of your life like you did to Steve?
The first sign of any little weakness and you just write people off.
You can say I'm pathetic and needy and I can't say anything to you?
"Everybody is not as tough as you, Miranda."
People Some of us make mistakes.
"Right there, next to the two for bin, Miranda and I had our first big fight."
"I thought by the time I got home, she'd have left an apology."
"I was gonna call her, but wasn't quite sure what to say."
Or whose fault it really was.
"And at the exact same moment across town, Miranda was preparing to make the call she'd been dreading all day."
I'd like to order some takeout.
"Chicken with broccoli, brown sauce, brown rice and cold noodles, right?'"
"After she hung up, Miranda couldn't get the giggle out of her head."
She decided to walk the two blocks to confront the woman with the judgmental giggle who thought she was better than her.
Miranda realized the giggle wasn't about her.
It wasn't the noodles that kept her coming back to this restaurant.
It was the fact that this was their place and it was filled with happy memories.
I thought I got custody of this place.
I like their hot and sour soup.
I've got this bowl of crunchies that I'll never get through.
Carrie and I had a huge fight.
"Miranda, only you and I really know what happened between you and l."
I didn't say nice things to her either.
I just don't want her to get hurt again.
I guess your new girlfriend doesn't yell.
I'd like the chicken with broccoli
I can't believe they go away for one night and then back three in a row.
I called them half an hour ago.
The idea that she'd miss a night's sleep pissed Samantha off.
"The idea that she'd miss an orgasm, was more than she could bear."
Keep talking and I'll come down there and cut it off for you.
"I'd like to see you try, motherfucker."
You think we want that BS?
Are you gonna pull a Lorena Bobbit?
a month and I have to put up with a trilogy of fucking trannies?
I am a taxpayer and member of the Women's Business Association.
I don't have to put up with this shit
Forget them and come back to bed.
There was nothing anyone could do to stop her.
"She had a date with Destiny, Chyna and Jo, no e ."
"I'm gonna come up there and kick your ass, bitch"
"You heard the man, move it along."
"And Uptown, Charlotte was a bit freaked out as well."
"Unable to sleep and unable to unpack, she was with the only man she could tolerate"
I saw your light on from the street.
I figured you'd still be up.
"Ever since you left, I can't stop thinking about you."
"Once Charlotte swore off men, this man couldn't get enough of her."
"He wasn't a rooster and it wasn't the Bronx but from deep inside, Trey's cock began to crow."
"Across town, I was still wide awake."
I couldn't get my fight with Miranda out of my head.
"I was not only capable of obsessing about relationships with men, I was capable of obsessing about relationships with women."
This is your neighbor who complained about the chickens.
I can't take it any more.
"I figured if they had a lovely life, I was entitled to the same thing."
I knew that was in me somewhere.
I just hadn't felt it since before
Do you think our whole problem had to do with the fact that
You didn't really wanna marry me.
I think it may be due to the fact that I didn't want to get married at all.
I guess I thought it was time.
"I'm of a certain age, people expect you to get married."
I married you because I knew I'd never find anyone as wonderful as you to marry.
"He may have gone away, the pre op transsexual, but he came back, loaded with eggs."
Samantha knew this was one relationship with a man she couldn't walk away from.
Because this man was half woman.
I was just gonna call you.
Do you really think I'm pathetic?
I don't think you're pathetic at all.
"I'm outside the restaurant, hiding in some bushes."
Do you still not think I'm pathetic? '
l know you think it's a huge mistake.
It's just something I feel I need to do to move on.
I have no idea what's right for you and Big.
"But if I'm wrong and it is a mistake, I need to know you'll be there for me."
That seems to be where you get into trouble.
My hair is in a duck pond.
I no longer smell of pond.
Exactly how many terry cloth robes do you have?
I swore I would never be in this room with you again.
You said to take you to the nearest shower.
I gotta ask you a question.
I was counting on you for answers.
Aside from the fact I feel like I've been through a war.
War buddies in Calvin Klein robes.
"I hate to admit this, but I kind of like living alone again."
Don't you want to stay a while?
"Because, sweet friend, you and I are like that red wall."
It's a good idea in theory.
"But somehow, it doesn't quite work."
"And just like that, I realized Big and I weren't us any more."
"What it was, I had no idea."
Call me when you get home.
"I had no idea where the chickens had gone, but I hoped it wasn't the Bronx."
And I hoped they were happy.
"Girl, I'm trying to get rid of one."
"The next Saturday, Samantha decided to throw a kiss and make up party for the Up my ass Players ."
Trey called me three times last week.
He's dying to get back together.
"So, what are we all drinking?"
I want you to give me a swirl.
"I need to see you spin first, sister."
"Don't worry, they have a very lovely life."
If you're single there's one thing you should always have when you go out on a Saturday night.
Why are we walking so fast?
Are we in that big a hurry to get to an engagement party?
"What, don't you guys want to go?"
"I did, until I saw this invitation."
That is totally not like Danny.
"It's a big, romantic gesture to express how they feel about each other."
If two people have only one thought between them something is very wrong.
I remember when Danny had more than one thought and they all involved going up my ass.
"He's cute, straight, and we've know him for years."
Haven't we all had sex with Danny?
"Yeah, that one weekend that I was bored."
Just a New Year's Eve kiss.
I showed him a boob in a coat check room.
"There he was, the fianc?? du jour."
"And this is my other half, Hailey."
"Hailey, this is Carrie and Charlotte."
Maybe you should've showed him both boobs.
And across the room from the two soul couple
I told the other numb nuts I wanted a Grey Goose an hour ago.
"So, Phil, what is it that you do?"
"I'm a TV agent, and I fucking love it."
We're actually taking some time apart.
We're just taking some time to figure things out.
"So now we're talking and trying to figure out what he actually we, he and I, really want."
"We love each other so much but that doesn't always mean a marriage is working, does it?"
We had some problems in the bedroom.
But it was more about the fact that we got married so fast.
So now we're just talking and trying to figure things out.
I think it's better if we just talk.
So we are talking till we figure it all out.
I have to Don't talk to her.
Charlotte realized that she and Trey were two souls with too many thoughts.
The minute we met it was perfect.
I knew we were meant to be together.
"I could stop looking, I had found him."
But I am seeing a whole bunch of unspecial guys.
That's one of the requirements to date me.
"But if you have any unspecial friends, could you give them my number?"
Do any of you have a totally unremarkable friend or maybe a house plant I could go to dinner with on Saturday night?
"Hey, what the hell was going on in there?"
Felt like your comedy routine should have a two drink minimum.
We were standing in a group of married or engaged women.
Just trying to avoid the pity party.
And I thought it was a cocktail party.
We were the only single people in there.
"Miranda, we're the only single people anywhere."
"Are you telling me you didn't see all those Don't worry, you'll find someone looks?"
Society views single people our age as sad and pathetic.
I don't need that judgment hanging over me.
I go on the offensive and make them laugh.
Sometimes I think people in couples wish they had our lives.
"We make them uncomfortable, and they don't know what to say."
And you're sure you're not overreacting?
I thought it was the horsemen of the apocalypse.
I cannot go to any more parties until I know what we're going to do.
"I've been awake, wondering if we should stay together in spite of issues."
"I don't want to confuse you, so I made some notes."
It helps me to be clear.
"The sex we had on the floor of your apartment was quite good, actually."
That does not a marriage make.
Maybe we can rack up a new score.
"Two, you only want me when you can't have me."
Did you make a note that mentions how beautiful you look tonight?
We have some big decisions to make.
I can't discuss my notes if you have a boner.
"I cannot come inside, we are separated."
I think about you every night.
May I take off your panties?
You said you didn't want to be married.
But now I don't know if I want to be married.
"That night, neither Charlotte nor Trey came inside."
I'm not quite sure what to say.
"I'm sorry, Charlotte, may I get you a hankie?"
It's too late for a hankie.
"Whatever this is we're doing, it isn't working."
I'll call you when I've figured out what I want.
Send me the dry cleaning bill.
"Trey may have had a lot of flaws, but bad manners wasn't one of them."
"It was a lovely, uneventful Saturday morning."
"Three lattes, two newspapers, and one dating service application."
You don't even have a name?
"I'm single, I don't deserve one."
That's the postal equivalent of a drive by shooting.
I thought those menus I get every day from Hunan Moonan were annoying.
Don't let your soul mate slip away.
"But hurry, 'cause he's slipping away."
Soul mates only exist in the Hallmark aisle in Duane Reade drugs.
I believe there's that one perfect person out there to complete you.
And if you don't find him?
"All right, first of all, the idea that there's only one out there why don't I just shoot myself right now?"
I'd like to think people have more than one soul mate.
"And if you miss one, along comes another, like cabs."
That is not how it works.
But you're still looking outside yourself.
It's saying that you're not enough.
The bad thing about the one perfect soul mate is that it's so unattainable.
You're being set up to fail.
"Exactly, and you feel bad about yourself."
It makes the gap between the Holy Grail and the assholes even bigger.
But I don't think that a soul mate would on your leg.
There's got to be that someone out there who's just perfect for me.
"Two little words, one big concept."
"A belief that someone, somewhere is holding the key to your heart, and your dream house."
All you have to do is find them.
And if you loved someone and it didn't work out does that mean they weren't your soul mate?
Were they just a runner up contestant in this game show called Happily Ever After ?
And as you move from age box to age box and the contestants get fewer and fewer are your chances of finding your soul mate less and less?
"Soul mates, reality or torture device?"
What about a little birthday dinner?
I'm not sure I want to do anything.
I'm kind of into laying low.
"Come on, you've got to do better than that."
"You've got to grab by the balls and say, World, I'm"
All you have to do is show up.
"Just close friends, very fabulous lite."
"What, are you slowly trying to kill me on the way to lunch?"
"Technically you are friends now, right?"
"You know, a phone call here and there."
Do you think I should I invite him?
"When I'm done with them, I'm done with them."
And I think he's still in London.
Let's just keep it to low maintenance friends.
It's so Robin and his merry men.
I'm not gonna lose my table at Pastis so you can cruise a holy man.
"What street are we on, again?"
"That Sunday, Samantha went to church."
I noticed all the good work you're doing in the neighborhood and I just stopped to see if I could be of service.
We could use another hand in the kitchen.
And I was thinking maybe I could help put a benefit together.
I can guarantee Donald Trump and Marlo Thomas.
"Thank you, but here at All Souls, we're a little more low key than that."
"We're more about collecting food, canned goods to feed to the needy."
I'm in the Franciscan order founded by St.
The robe is Do you really want to hear about this?
Tell me more about this St. Francis.
He lived his life based on the vows of poverty and chastity.
Francis giving his coat to the poor.
If you change your mind about the benefit or anything.
"And just like that, Samantha went from Mr."
"After church, most people go out for pancakes."
Did you get a facial or something?
"Two, two and a half hours."
Who's got that kind of time?
I like to get in and get out.
"I enjoy a quickie every now and then but when it's good like today, I go with it."
I think we might have to get her a crash helmet.
"She wants him, but she can't have him."
"In my fantasy he tears the food I'm carrying for the homeless out of my arms, rips open my dress lays me down in the street and enters me."
What do you do for the next hours and minutes?
"Stop, you are talking about a priest."
I can masturbate to whomever I like.
Who do you all fantasize about?
What did women do before Russell Crowe?
I used to masturbate to a busboy who was rude to me once.
What do you think that means?
"Get that judgmental puss off, and join in."
"Come on, it can't be any worse than a priest and a busboy."
We're not moving on till you tell us about one of your masturbation guys.
"And we have this really, you know, perfect sex."
What do you think it means?
"I'm not in, so please leave a message."
"I think you're still in England but it's midnight here in New York, and it's my birthday."
So I felt the need to call someone older.
"Anyway, some friends are giving me a dinner tomorrow night."
"Actually it's tonight, and you're a friend."
"So if you are back in town it's going to be at II Cantinori, at p."
"And if you're still in London then cheerio, old chap."
"The next day, on Wall Street"
Joe and I just got back from New Orleans.
But Miranda wasn't feeling very Shecky.
"Look, he's out there for you somewhere."
"You just haven't met him yet, right?"
I don't know if I believe all that.
Maybe there isn't someone for everyone.
"No Hallmark hope, no two drink minimum."
You've been married for how many years?
"I bet you're thinking, Where are the kids?"
It's like I said to Joe.
We can have kids or we can have gorgeous fabric without chocolate stains.
Miranda realized it's not just about being single.
Everyone has a sore spot that needs a little comedy routine.
Not because it was particularly funny but because it was kind.
They told me you were inside.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
You and the work that you do.
I have a confession to make.
I think about you other places than the market.
Do you ever think about me?
I believe that God made the body.
And it's perfect in its splendor.
But I'm not of my body.
My life is about other joys.
Samantha wondered if maybe the hot monk was her soul mate as he was certainly unattainable.
I arrived at my party after a day of shopping.
With no true soul mate I spent the afternoon with my shoe soul mate Manolo Blahnik.
"Good evening, can I help you?"
Would you like a drink whilst waiting?
"I'll have a Shirley Temple, please."
"Once everyone else gets here, we'll be drinking a lot of champagne."
"Twenty minutes later, still no party."
Did anyone call asking for Bradshaw?
Let me check with the maitre d'.
Can I bring you some champagne now?
"Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Marta Happy birthday to you"
I can't imagine where everybody is.
"There is only one II Cantinori, right?"
The woman with the birthday cake is here and she needs to be paid.
After I paid for my own birthday cake I was totally out of the party mood.
So I decided to go home and kill myself.
"It's wet, get the hell off there"
"Marilyn Monroe, do me a fucking favor, get off the road"
"We'll bring some beer over, and we'll have"
By the time I got home I had fallen into an emotional hole so deep only a fireman without a collarbone could rescue me.
"Honey, I'm trapped at work, I'll be minutes late."
"The reservation line is busy, I'll see you soon."
"No one can get through, don't wait for me."
I don't know how to spell II Cantinori for the idiot at
Did you know there's a Mexican restaurant on University and h called El Cantinoro?
"Okay, so now we're coming uptown."
Meet you at the coffee shop in minutes.
"I'm sorry, I came to take you to the coffee shop."
I'm not in the mood to be with a bunch of people.
"Come on, it's just the four of us."
"You have to come, it's your birthday."
"The longer I sat there, the more alone I felt."
"I know I have you guys, but And really, I hate myself a little for saying this, but it felt really sad not to have a man in my life who cares about me."
No special guy to wish me happy birthday.
And I don't even know if I believe in soul mates.
"Don't laugh at me, but maybe we could be each other's soul mates."
"And then we could let men be just these great, nice guys to have fun with."
"Not really, I'm on London time."
"In that case, I'm really fucking late."
I can't believe you actually got out of the car and got balloons.
You don't have to give me an exact number.
I don't know what you're referring to.
I had something in my eye.
How do you feel about soul mates?
Well I like the word soul.
"Other than that, you got me."
Did you have a nice day?
"As Big's car drove away, I realized having three soul mates already nailed down made it a lot easier to spot those great, nice guys to have fun with."
"A little past m, I was dressed to the nines at Brasserie"
Located on the corner of Right Now and Everyone Was There it was the place to see and be seen.
Do you think he's a model?
"A model citizen, a model home a model airplane?"
I think he's the dirty haired Gucci guy with clean hair.
Why don't you go over and say hello?
The only way to get a guy like him interested in me would be to pay.
"My love, there's no need for you to enter Hookerville."
"Carrie, I know what I look like."
Then you can't see what I see.
Lynne Cameron was a much sought after fashion show producer as valuable to a show's success as Valium or Velcro.
I just told Damian you have just so fucking saved my life.
"Sorry, this is my boyfriend, Damian."
"I use the term boyfriend loosely, as Damian is clearly a homosexual."
"In that case, this is my boyfriend, Stanford."
You so have to be in this fashion show I'm doing.
A mix of models and New York people with style.
And no one is more New York or has more style than you.
"You're fucking doing my show if I have to hunt you down skin you alive, and have one of the other models fucking wear you."
Could this place be any louder?
Then you can't see what I see.
I'll start with a salad with extra blue cheese dressing.
Are the vegetables on the veggie plate organic?
"They have beef pot pie on the menu, what do you think?"
I'll just have a cup of hot water with lemon.
Isn't it hard to eat just organic all the time?
Last night I could not stop thinking about a Big Mac.
"I finally had to get dressed, go out and pick up a guy."
"Lady, you have never looked better."
I'm having nude photographs taken on Wednesday.
Have postcards made up to hand out to prospective dates?
This is not about a man's approval.
This photo is just for me.
"So when I'm old and my tits are in my shoes I can look at it and say, Damn, I was hot."
No one thinks that when you get your seventh grade picture taken.
"I'm getting these pictures taken, what's the big problem?"
I think it's fantastic that you can just put it out there.
I can't even say yes to being in some charity fashion show.
You were asked to be part of that?
All the top designers are doing it.
They want you to be a model?
"No, it's a mix of real people and models."
"You have to do it, you live for fashion."
I do not live for fashion.
How many fashion shows did you drag me to during Fashion Week?
Why are you turning down the chance to actually be in one?
I do not belong on a runway.
"Runways are for models, not writers."
What's the difference between strutting down a runway and the way you strut down Fifth Avenue?
I was a teen model when the Ralph Lauren store opened in New Haven.
"Okay, it's amazing I was able to keep my lunch down just now."
I just I cannot imagine walking down a runway while people sit there and judge me.
We judge models all the time.
"But you're not a model, you're one of the real people."
I don't want people to think that I can't see the difference between a model and me.
Who gives a fuck what people think?
You'll probably get to keep the clothes.
I'd do it in a New York minute.
While Miranda would never dream of walking on a runway she had no problem running on one.
I happen to know you were on that treadmill for longer than minutes.
That's illegal here at Crunch Fitness.
I'm starting to train for the marathon.
"I was the captain of my high school track team, but the marathon I'm Dave."
I've been watching you for months.
I think that you are very sexy.
"He said, I think you're very sexy."
I was wearing no makeup and my Hanes old man's undershirt.
I can't believe a guy would think that I was sexy.
"Sexy is the thing I try to get them to see me as, after I win them over with my personality."
You win men over with your personality?
They want you to be a model?
"Later that night, I got to thinking about Narcissus."
"A man so consumed with his own image, he drowned in it."
Did he have no best friends to mirror back a healthier view of himself?
"And why is it that we can see our friends perfectly but when it comes to ourselves, no matter how hard we look do we ever see ourselves clearly?"
"Samantha, on the other hand, saw herself a little too clearly."
"Okay, Samantha Tiger, here, has a variety of music choices to ease you into the shoot and help you to feel more comfortable."
I think I might wanna see someone else.
Trey and I are still just talking.
We're not ready to move back in yet.
"Sweetie, I'm not bugged, it's just us listening."
I don't wanna talk about this.
Can you call my machine and leave her number?
Do you know anyone that Stanford could go out with?
"If we don't find someone, he's gonna start dating hookers."
Charlotte would you say that I'm strutting right now?
"Charlotte decided for Stanford Blatch, it would have to be someone cute."
"Someone with style, someone like Anthony, her wedding gown stylist."
"Sorry, thought it was my mother."
"I get her the cheapest sheets I can, from Bed, Bath and friggin' Beyond."
I was wondering if you were dating anyone now.
"In a movie, who would play him?"
I don't know A younger Ed Harris.
"And speaking of hot, Miranda ended her first date with Captain Crunch."
I hope I didn't talk too much.
"I think the only words you actually said all night were, That was fun."
"After all, who was Miranda to argue with the Captain?"
Miss Motherfucker why have you not returned my last phone calls?
I really don't think that I should do this show.
"I mean, come on, I am not a model."
"And as much as I would like to think Carrie, you're in or you're out, I don't have time for this."
I'm sure Dolce Gabbana can find someone else to dress.
Each designer picks the person they want to dress.
And those are some picky Italians.
Do you think that I would be able to keep the outfit?
Perfect in the bust and the waist.
We must take it up about four feet.
But I'm very comfortable in heels.
So feel free to put me up in the big gal shoes.
"If we gave it to Heidi, we wouldn't have to take it up."
Look what the pussies dragged in.
"We're just calling me O now, love."
"Carrie Bradshaw, our New York Style model."
"I'm Sure, I love I'm sorry."
I just I know your photographs.
I'm doing a little behind the scenes book about Fashion Week.
Do you mind if I shoot your fitting?
"That's the point, don't mind me."
I like the element of surprise.
"I could give you a surprise, love."
"I don't know, whatever you think."
"No, changed my mind, got something better."
"I'm sorry, I'm very uncomfortable having my photograph taken."
How does a girl who doesn't like having her picture taken wind up in a fashion show?
I'm in it for the free goods.
Maybe if I explained how a camera works over a glass of wine sometime
I've never been a gal to turn down a free lesson.
Okay you can put your legs down now.
It is not a yeast infection.
I have an entire file of women all with the same symptoms.
All of them think they have a yeast infection.
We can get it under control.
I'm gonna prescribe a light antidepressant.
The mood elevator sort of corrects the imbalance.
"Wait, how do you know your vagina's depressed?"
It always wants to go to Krispy Kreme?
"It's so funny, my vagina's depressed."
"So, everyday I have to keep a vagina journal."
"A Dear vagina, why so blue?"
Dear vagina guess who I have a crush on?
But could I have a hot water and lemon?
"I'm fine, but, Charlotte, maybe your hmm hmm would like an order of fries."
I had to pick up my nude contact sheets.
"Okay, but only until the food arrives."
"Charlotte, I want your professional art eye opinion."
I just did that to warm up.
"You should have warned me, really."
I've never even seen mine that close.
You've never seen yourself up close and personal?
Have you seen yours that close?
You've never looked at yourself with a hand mirror?
"Honey, I insist you go home right now and take a look."
"Or better yet, take my compact and make a quick trip to the ladies' room."
On their second date Miranda did most of the talking.
She was feeling confident and sexy.
"I love my job, I love my friends."
She couldn't believe how comfortable this new Miranda felt.
And I love meeting new people like you.
Miranda had no idea what had changed.
I'm thinking ash or a charcoal gray matte inside the frame.
Even though Samantha had done the photo just for her she still wanted to be seen a certain way by men.
Charcoal would bring out the gray tones.
"The matte should stop about an inch away from my breast right here, see my breast?"
"And then stop right around here, near my ass."
And you took this one of Cindy Crawford.
I loved her beauty mark so much.
"I used to pencil one on, you know, and then I'd move it around whenever I had a blemish."
"So, you know, it'd be here, then here and sometimes here and here."
I can't believe you have this book.
"When I first moved to New York, and I was broke sometimes I would buy Vogue instead of dinner."
I just felt it fed me more.
I used to do all that high fashion shit but the behind the scenes stuff I'm doing now is so much better.
The reality of people and all their little flaws it's the little flaws that make them so much more beautiful.
Forget reality and tell me about the models.
Who's a big bitch and who's a bigger bitch?
Sorry I never click and tell.
Why are you so fascinated with the models?
You show me one model who's more alive or more beautiful than her.
"So, which one is your new boyfriend?"
I'm nervous about the Charlotte fix up.
"You look fabulous, have fabulous seats."
I can't think about you now.
I made them put me in these super high heels.
I'm gonna be so freaking tall.
"Supermodel and super size it, please."
"Excuse me, hi, I'm Carrie Bradshaw."
"Look, this is the Polaroid of the dress."
These are the other real people?
"What, Dolce Gabbana couldn't get Ed Koch?"
"Gucci got him, what's the problem?"
Actually convinced myself I belonged here.
"No, the entire show is timed per model."
"Okay, so you're not Heidi Klum."
But you're the modeliest of the real people.
"I mean, he told me I was sexy."
And then he didn't want to kiss me.
You can lay your pussy on a table in front of one and still not know what he's thinking.
And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse
"There's been a change, you're not wearing this."
I'm gonna need to speak to someone.
"I had to lose the dress, love."
I saw that Dior is showing something similar right before you.
It's a fashion house of cards.
I just want you to look at them.
How can I make this clear?
"Try them on, you'll love them."
"No, please, really, I'm gonna faint."
I can't wear jeweled panties and strut out in front of Frank Rich.
"You're not just wearing panties, love."
They come with a fantastic coat.
Trot round there and try them on.
"I have a certain look, you know?"
And I just really don't think that jeweled panties is it.
"If you look like a whale, we won't send you out there."
Now come out or I'm coming in.
I'd better go check on Carrie.
"Try Ed, I have no hair is."
I thought you two would hit it off.
"Why, because he's gay and I'm gay?"
Let me clear something up for you.
"I got good arms and a high, tight ass."
I could do a lot better.
Ten minutes and ten hair extensions later
I can't believe Charlotte would set me up with such a queen.
Is that who she thinks I am?
I don't have time to decipher the levels of queendom in your world right now.
Would you please go get me another champagne?
We need the big eyes to go with the big hair.
"Nice to meet you, ready for makeup?"
"Hi, I know you're a genius, but here's the thing."
"I know, I'm a big fan of your column."
"Don't worry, you're gonna look fabulous."
They keep telling me I'm fabulous.
Carrie needs to see you backstage.
"Your little friend, where is he?"
I've been rejected by someone I wasn't interested in.
"I know people don't mean it when they say that, but I do."
Wait till you see our gal.
"Oh, my God, she's fashion roadkill."
"I had a choice, I could slink off the runway and let my inner model die of shame or I could pick myself up, flaws and all, and finish."
And that's just what I did.
Because when real people fall down in life they get right back up and keep on walking.
"Turns out, my little act of bravery inspired three other people to acts of bravery as well."
Miranda faced her fear of knowing the truth.
I thought we had a good time and then you never called.
And I never called because you never called.
"I guess that's fine, but I just have to know."
"We were sitting on the couch, and you just You seem a little full of yourself."
"Okay, glad we straightened that out."
Samantha faced her fear of what real food would do to her perfect figure.
And Charlotte faced her fear of seeing herself.
"And just like Narcissus before her Charlotte became so mesmerized by what she saw, that"
And as for me I tucked my jeweled underwear and my inner model away where they belonged and went back to my life as a real person.
"Someone once said that when one door shuts, a window opens."
Big and I had shut our door but our window was open and blowing a great breeze.
I'm gonna bring back the watch fob.
"Now that Big and I weren't playing the dating game, we were free to just play and it had never been better."
The ladies enjoy sleight of hand.
Young's cocktail party another set of ex's were enjoying the view.
Look at all the shades of green in the hillside.
What's beautiful is your ass in that skirt.
Now that Trey and Charlotte had opened the door of communication Trey wanted to get in everywhere.
I'd like to do some very dirty things to you right now.
"We're at Winky and Bob's cocktail party, and I'm your estranged wife."
My estranged wife has a damn fine ass.
I think it's really great how up for things you've been lately.
"So why don't we get our coats and go back to your place because my ass will be damn fine there, too."
"For a radiologist, he's awfully full of himself."
They were passed over for three Park Avenue co ops because of that yippie dog.
That's what you get for over breeding the Pekingese.
Certain behavior will keep you from getting into a co op.
And certain behavior is almost assured to get you kicked out of one.
The entire surgical staff of Lennox Hill Hospital is in the next room.
"They'll understand, this is an emergency."
While Charlotte walked through her door I reached mine and kept it firmly closed.
I think I got it from here.
Then I'll watch from down here in case you trip.
What's with the There will be no
"Okay, you're the boss But I'm always available for the Nighty night."
Have you guys ever done it in a restaurant bathroom?
"Are these theoretical questions, or are you getting busy, missy?"
"Apparently he can, all over Manhattan."
This is a very happy development.
"No, we're not even together anymore."
Doesn't sound that way to me.
"We're supposed to be getting to know each other again, not Fucking against a hand dryer?"
Are we dating or are we back together?
Is he my boyfriend or my lover?
Or my ex husband whom I have sex with occasionally in coatrooms?
"I'm going with D, all of the above."
"No, I need to know where we're going."
"We'd like to know, too, since you'll be having sex there."
"He's my husband, we were defined by law."
"Now it's all blurry, it's so hard."
What did you do this weekend?
So you and Big are really friends or something?
I am not sleeping with him.
"It's fun, in fact now that the pressure's off, we're finally enjoying each other."
"Without boundaries, you won't know what'll happen."
"Have fun, just don't have amnesia."
Can we lighten up on the boundary talk?
Are you thinking about sleeping with him?
The Eskimo have hundreds of words for snow.
And we've invented three times that many words for relationship.
"But the more words we invent, the harder it becomes to define things."
In a world where you can date without sex screw without dating and in the end keep most of your sex partners as friends long after the screwing is over what really defines a relationship?
"That night, Miranda let her boundaries down with Doug a cartoonist for The New Yorker."
They had been dating for about a month.
"Miranda didn't know what they were, but she knew it felt good."
It was a morning of firsts.
It was the first time Doug had spent the night and the first time a man had peed in front of her.
"That night, we went to Charlotte's gallery for the opening of an exhibit by Maria Diega Reyes, the Brazilian artist."
You can probably say he's your boyfriend.
Only a boyfriend would do that.
I don't want a boyfriend who does that.
It's never okay to do that.
"Wait your turn, shut the door, do your business."
I have a bone to pick with you.
"I came ready to buy, and look all these red dots, there's nothing left."
That's never bad news for the artist.
But I have many more in my loft.
"If you ever want to come down, take a look"
"I will, and soon, before those get sold out from underneath me, as well."
Now a non art related question.
Where are all the hot guys?
"It is stunning, all of it."
"I'm so proud of you, chica."
"That's good for you, but what's in it for me?"
"The next night, my ex introduced me to a tiny jazz club in the East Village."
"Loosen up, baby, we're below h Street."
"There I was, inches away from my ex boyfriend friend, whatever lusting after a bass player."
We're gonna take a short break.
"When we come back, if you're nice we'll play another set or two."
"Apparently, everyone in the universe wanted me to define my relationship with Big."
"Didn't think I had that groovy jazz club in me, did you?"
"Hey, man, you were really great."
"Not great, I'm just trying to keep up."
Can I buy you a drink?
It's the only way they'll let me play.
At least I can drink for free.
Hell of a lot of mortgages.
So then we'll take a cab.
You sure your bass is gonna be okay?
"Yeah, sleeps at the club all the time."
Sometimes it even hooks up with the snare drum.
"Listen, can I get your number?"
"Sure, let me just I'm a writer with no pen."
Now he's gonna think we're together.
"What, you like the porkpie hat?"
"I'll tell you, he had some breath on him."
It was like he had a bad burger with B.B.
We gotta figure out what we're doing here.
Friends who listen to jazz friends who eat pizza.
I have to go to sleep.
My bizarre m??nage ? taxi was haunting me.
"You know, when I hear that song, I think of you."
"I don't even know you, how fucked up is that?"
Can you hang on a second?
"Listen, I'd like to take you out on Saturday night."
I promise you won't have to listen to me play.
What do you see in that guy?
He knows when to say good bye.
"The next morning, Miranda decided I might have been right."
If she wanted a decent relationship she couldn't throw the boy out with the toilet water.
She would have to let down her boundaries.
And there was no better time than the present.
While Miranda tried to do her business Samantha helped Maria with hers.
"You know, painting is like eating, like sex."
"You know, I came to buy art, not make it."
Everyone that crosses my door has to help.
"But you have a choice, really."
You can make a painting or you can do my laundry.
"You're buying one of my paintings, right?"
Do we Do we need to talk about this?
"I've done the girl thing once, twice usually involving a guy and a couple of Quaaludes."
And really nice for the guy.
But I'm not a relationship person.
"In my language, friends translates to a person with a warm heart that buys a lot of my art."
What's Portuguese for working it ?
"The next day, I found the perfect color on me."
"Excuse me, but is that a hickey?"
"Oh, my God, I don't That's so retro."
Trey and I made out in the movies.
"Right in the middle of the movie, I gave him a blow job."
"Once I stopped defining everything, I realized how great we have it."
"It sounds like you got a nice, healthy relationship."
Charlotte realized if Samantha defined her relationship as healthy she had one sick relationship on her hands.
"The next day, as Trey looked for action Charlotte went looking for answers."
Should we go to a movie?
We're five blocks from your place.
We'll just wait and we'll get in our old bed and we'll really make love like man and wife.
"Are you so scared that if we go back to a bed, you'll have the same problems again?"
Let's not discuss this in front of the driver.
You just wanted to have sex in front of him.
And just like that Charlotte slammed the door on her and Trey.
"So if we were to, say make love in my bed could we still do it in a taxi?"
"All right then, call you tomorrow."
"Evidently, when Charlotte closed the taxi door she opened a whole new window."
"The next morning, Miranda got up early to pee in peace and make Doug coffee."
It's the cinnamon I add to the
"Apparently, when Miranda left the door open for peeing she opened the door for everything else."
Sometimes I like to add a pinch of nutmeg to my coffee it takes a lot of the
"But for Miranda, an open door dump was definitely worth dumping someone over."
"That's the thing about New York, everyone's always going."
"Tonight, it was to the opening of Tao."
This is the only restaurant in New York opening tonight?
The Burger King on Ninth Avenue had a line around the block.
"I got the last table, let's go."
"There we were, me, my ex the jazz guy, the model the lesbian, and her friend Samantha."
Think we'll ever get our Mee Krob?
Is there any more wine in there?
"Look at me, I grabbed some Mee Krob."
Turns out the chef worked at one of my clubs.
You know all the right people.
I got the in on the noodles.
"If it's okay with you, I'm gonna camp out here for a while."
Good thing we weren't fucking hungry.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
"Turn right at the Buddha, honey."
"Just to, you know, get things straight you and Carrie are just friends now, right?"
So if you're just friends what exactly do you think you're doing?
Because that girl might come off like she's all strong and over it but she's fragile and she's my best friend.
So I suggest you back off.
Can't we all just get along?
That guy's not good for her.
I can't just be your friend.
What I saw back there You were magnificent.
And how do you say that You kick ass.
And I see where this is going and you don't do relationships.
It would be very bad for me.
So we can't even be friends?
I'm gonna go in here and you go back there.
Right then and there Samantha decided to let down her boundaries and opened herself up to the possibility of a relationship with a woman.
I don't really have to go.
Did you two used to date or something?
"Okay, I'm gonna My date's waiting for me."
"Everywhere I went, I was confronted by my Big relationship."
I just left silent Y in the bathroom and P.S.
", apparently the ' are back."
"Okay, Ray and I were gonna go first."
You know what I love about this city?
Everything can sound like a jazz riff.
'Cause I get more of a Like a I don't know.
"You really don't know jazz, do you?"
"I just scatted on my first date, man, give me some credit."
"Somewhere between the Mee Krob and the model, I was dating again."
"Do do do, right back at you."
With every second of our kiss it was becoming clearer I really liked this guy.
What ultimately defines a relationship is another relationship.
"New York City, no matter how well you think you know it there's always somewhere or someone new to discover."
"I was on my second date with Ray King, who lived in Queens but it felt like our second, third and fourth date because we'd been to three jazz clubs in one night."
"I can't sing for shit, but damn, can I chop."
And where does one learn this skill?
This lick right here is why I wanted to play the bass.
This might be a good time to tell you I don't like jazz.
Why would you say something like that?
"I don't know, you can't follow it and there's no melody."
And it's just like It's all over the place.
"Carrie, you gotta stop trying to make it be something else and appreciate it for what it is."
"Damn, I wish I had my bass."
"Come here, you be the bass."
Don't I have to be in the musician's union or something?
"I learn a few notes, I get bored, I move on."
The beauty of jazz is that it can go anywhere.
It can go from here to here to here
It was right about that time that I started to appreciate a little type of music we call jazz.
So what did you do last night?
What is so funny about jazz?
"Last night, with Ray I had the most intense orgasm of my entire life."
"It doesn't make sense, I barely know him."
We've only been on two dates.
And yet you had sex with him.
Can everyone please let Carrie talk about the sex?
"Now I realize that this next statement makes me a bit of a freak, but I usually have to be in love with someone to have that kind of orgasm."
You might want to see someone about that.
What the hell is going on?
Your clitoris seems to think so.
It was probably just a fluke.
I'm going back tomorrow to find out.
"I, on the other hand, am on strike."
It means I'm not having any more sex.
"That's not a strike, honey, that's a slump."
"No, it might have started as a slump, but I'm in control of it now."
I've made the conscious decision not to have sex until conditions improve.
How many people will be affected by this strike?
"So far, just the one, but I'm optimistic."
"The thing is, I can't go on any more bad dates."
I would rather be home alone than out with some guy who sells socks on the Internet.
"She's my Maria now, we're having a relationship."
Please get those looks off your faces.
And this is Carrie and Miranda.
It's so nice to meet you.
"You go to bed, you wake up the next morning and you're a lesbian?"
"I forgot to tell you, I'm a fire hydrant."
"I always wanted to be one, and now I am."
"I don't think she's a lesbian, I think she just ran out of men."
"Then you go on strike, you don't eat pussy."
Did you just say eat pussy ?
"I did, but just for emphasis."
"You know, the truly amazing thing is, I had the news tonight."
"Mind blowing, I believe was the word."
orgasm of my life and Samantha still managed to up sex me.
"Later that night, inspired by Samantha's willingness to explore new territory Charlotte felt it was time to conquer some old territory."
The bed where she and Trey had so much trouble as man and wife.
Should we have a glass of wine first?
Just because she was on strike didn't mean she had to do without.
That's how Miranda discovered the perfect relationship.
"be here today and she is, from what I understand, in love with me."
That night Charlotte and Trey enjoyed a sweet ending to their evening as well.
Now that they had fixed their problem in the bedroom she was ready to move back into the other rooms as well.
I'm thinking I've never seen my John Thomas so hard.
"I swear, at times I felt like it was gonna rocket right off."
Should I Do you Are we ready to
"Houston, we don't have a problem."
"So, did you and the girls run down the street talking about me?"
After all the hours I've spent listening to you people talk about your relationships.
Do you think you love him?
You just caught us a little off guard with the lesbian thing.
"That's just a label, like Gucci or Versace."
This is not about being gay or straight.
"She's got passion, and talent intelligence"
Is that what the lesbians are calling it?
"For your information, we haven't even had sex yet."
You really are in a relationship.
Life is not all about sex.
Try telling that to her schmagina.
"I want a bourbon, and I want to go down on you."
The truth is I really want it to be special the first time.
I'm sure that it will be special.
"I'm sure it will be special, because"
"The next day, I thought about what Samantha said."
She wasn't having sex because she wanted to have a relationship and I was having mind blowing sex hoping to turn it into a relationship.
We've got a relationship without sex and sex without a relationship.
Which had a better shot at survival?
"I couldn't help but wonder, what comes first, the chicken or the sex?"
That night I decided to really talk to Ray.
I figured we needed to catch the relationship up to the sex.
Where did you go to school?
"Freckles on the legs, nothing wrong with that."
It was my best relationship ever.
"Meanwhile, over at Casa de Lesbo"
That coq au vin was amazing.
"You can paint, you can cook, you can do everything."
But you brought the most incredible dessert.
Samantha decided if she was going to be gay she'd be gay all the way.
I might not be much in the kitchen but I'm more than enough in the bedroom.
It's not really working for me.
It was a phrase Samantha had never heard in bed before.
"Honey, I've never gotten any complaints from the men."
I want you to look at me.
And I want you to look at my boceta.
It's a Portuguese word for pussy.
"Meanwhile, Miranda, still off sex and on chocolate couldn't bring herself to order the seven ??clairs she really wanted."
So she asked for just one.
Miranda decided she didn't need a cake that badly especially when she could make one for under
"Every once in a while, a girl has to indulge herself."
He still hasn't asked me to move back in.
We make love all over the apartment.
In the morning I get in a cab and go home like a Park Avenue hooker
"We finally got the penis working, I don't want to scare it."
Why can't I have the relationship and the sex?
Why is it one or the other?
"Listen, you guys, when she gets here, we have to talk about her relationship."
She was mad we didn't take it seriously last time.
"She isn't having a relationship, she's just doing this to bug us."
They haven't even had sex yet.
She said she wants it to be special.
This is the healthiest thing she's done in ages.
Does anybody want to split the chocolate pudding?
How is everything going with Maria?
Did you know that when a vagina gets engorged it expands to the size of a fist?
And we have three holes down there.
"Okay, stop talking about your relationship."
There are places a dick just can't go.
"For the record, you started this."
I am sorry but a finger is not a dick.
A finger is more like a third of a dick.
"So technically, Maria only has three and a third dicks."
"I can tell you right now, this is not the same as this."
"I'm just saying, size has nothing to do with it."
Not only do I now know everything there is to know about the glorious boceta That's Portuguese for pussy.
"Boceta, schmagina, let's call the whole thing off."
The most important thing is that Maria has taught me how to connect during sex.
It's not just some animal act.
It's about two people making love.
"Come on in, I'm making margaritas."
You gotta hear that on vinyl.
"Don't scat, don't chop, don't blend Could we Could we just sit and talk for a while?"
"The gotta talk girl, gotta talk."
"I'm not any girl, I just want to talk."
You said something about the Jersey Shore.
I spent a couple summers there.
There was a skeet shooting place I went to.
"Man, why no skeet in the city?"
I should open one in New York.
When was the last time you had canned corn?
"No, because remember I met I had a pot pie in Vegas once, loaded with corn"
As Ray talked I realized he wasn't spontaneous and unpredictable and thrilling.
He was a guy with ADD.
What kind of relationship could I have with a guy I couldn't even talk to?
Charlotte gave Trey one more chance to ask her to move in.
Next time I'm hard would you consider measuring my John Thomas?
"I understand, it's juvenile, I know."
But I've just never seen it like this.
Charlotte was never a woman who cared much about penises and now a penis was running her life.
As Charlotte lathered up she really started to get lathered up.
Who did he think he was?
"He was her husband, and she was his wife."
What the hell was going on in this Upper East Side nightmare?
I'm tired of being married to your penis
This is supposed to be a relationship
And I am done walking on eggshells
Don't talk about moving in in front of the penis 'cause it might go soft.
"The penis likes this, and The penis doesn't like that"
And The penis wants to be measured
You can shove this marriage up your ass
"I'm going home to my own apartment, where I have a lease."
I hope that you and your penis have a very lovely night
"Meanwhile, Miranda was getting fed up as well with herself."
"Hi, it's me, leave a message."
"I know you're probably busy having mind blowing sex right now but I feel that you need to know, your good friend, Miranda Hobbes has just taken a piece of cake out of the garbage and eaten it."
You'll probably need this information when you check me in to the Betty Crocker Clinic.
That night Miranda realized she'd been using chocolate as a substitute for sex and now she needed a substitute for chocolate.
Just when she thought she knew everything there was to know about women Samantha caused the very elusive female ejaculation.
Samantha got the relationship and the sex.
"In fact, a little more sex than she'd expected."
"The next morning, I woke up with a new thought."
"Instead of trying to make him be something else, I needed to let go and appreciate him for what he was."
But unfortunately I got the feeling Ray had stopped playing me and moved on to another instrument.
You left something at my At the apartment.
I want you to move back in and get rid of this old apartment.
"And stay all night, every night."
And wake up next to me every morning and be my wife.
I talked it over with my penis and we both agree.
I don't want to lose you again.
Charlotte York MacDougal will you remarry me?
"Yes, Trey MacDougal I will remarry you."
"Walking home from ADD, another dating disaster I worried that there's a reason they call it mind blowing sex."
Maybe that kind of physical connection obliterates the chance of an intellectual one.
Or maybe it's possible to find both.
"That's what I was hoping, because great sex is great but I still like a song with a melody I can sing to."
New York City can be a terrifying place.
"Just coffee and a muffin, please."
Nothing's more frightening than the prospect of seeing an ex before you've had your morning coffee.
You made me burn my tongue.
"I got to work on that, sorry."
I guess that means you didn't get the invitation yet.
I'm opening up my own bar.
I'd really love it if you'd come.
We'd love to see you there.
"She we'd him, Carrie, right in front of me."
How can you have had an emotional mini drama already?
No way I'm going to his opening.
Do you think I should go?
Let me think for a second.
What really pisses me off is it was my idea.
I'm the one who told him to open his own bar.
But do I get any credit?
Why wasn't he this ambitious while with me?
Maybe he named the bar Miranda's or Hobbes' Nob.
"You guys are friends now, right?"
"You're my friend, does that mean you have to go?"
"According to Steve's girlfriend, Jessica who answered his phone while he was in the shower today"
"I love how you say Jessica, like allegedly that's her name."
I wonder why I didn't get an invitation.
"You can have mine, sister, 'cause I'm not going."
"Come on, it's a big party, you may not even see him."
It's a parade of our failed relationships.
"Next, you're gonna tell me that my junior prom date's the barback."
It means he's ready to be friends.
"I don't know what it means, don't want to find out."
"It means, I forgive you, please come."
"I'm going out with Samantha and her lesbian lover, and I am proud."
I could use a night away from the old ball and chain.
Don't tell me you're in a sapphic slump.
"All we ever do is lie around, take baths together and talk about feelings."
I think they call that a relationship.
I don't know how you do it.
"All that emotional chow chow, it's exhausting."
"I know, don't you just hate that?"
"That night, Samantha was determined to get Maria out of the tub and out on the town."
"I do not see why we're out in this crowd with all this smoke, when we could be home, relaxing together."
"I thought it'd be fun to take our relationship out on dry land for a change, that's all."
"Besides, what's the fun of getting clean if you can't get a little dirty first?"
"Samantha Jones what's it gonna be tonight, darling, the usual?"
Brian here happens to make the most dangerous mojitos in the city.
"Two mojitos coming up, on the house."
"Sean Sullivan, what are you doing in town?"
Back on business for a few weeks.
What are you doing next Saturday?
"How about a late run, then?"
What is this late run ?
I didn't know that we had plans on Saturday.
I promised the girls I'd go out with them.
"But since you don't really like to go out, I thought"
"Samantha had to face her past, and Charlotte was facing her future."
Now that Trey had no problem getting hard in the bedroom she saw no reason why their bed should be.
When Trey told me you two were buying a new bed I insisted he let me help.
"I picked out the one he has now, did you know that?"
"Still at the hospital, I expect."
"Don't fret, we'll find a mattress to fit the frame."
"You know, we were hoping to find a bed that was a little bigger and less hard."
"My dear, I'm a firm believer in firm mattresses."
Five pleat gusseted duster with a foot drop.
I have one just like it.
"Actually, Bunny most of the newer beds don't even need dust ruffles."
"My dear child, you cannot not have a dust ruffle."
"I see you've started without me, Mother."
"Trey, you simply must get in and feel this, it's sublime."
"Charlotte, you really must try this."
I was thinking more along the line
"Charlotte, for heaven's sake, get in."
"I'm sorry, this is just way too"
I think I might have a ghost.
I think I might have to hear that again.
"There were weird noises last night, right above me."
That's some weird upstairs neighbor's nocturnal what have you.
"That's what I thought, too, at first."
But this morning the super let me in upstairs and there's no one living there.
"And I know it sounds crazy, but last night I could feel it."
"Did the cat feel it, too?"
The hairs on the back of my neck all stood up.
And finally she had to tell it to leave.
That's exactly what you're supposed to do.
"Confront the ghost, acknowledge its presence, then release it."
How do you happen to know that?
"The thing that I don't understand is, why now?"
I've been living there for two years.
"When I was living alone, I used to feel scared like that all the time."
"But now that I'm back with Trey, I feel so safe."
I have a ghost because I'm single?
"Anyone you have unresolved issues with, you are bound to run into again and again until you resolve them."
"My relationship with Aidan was long dead, but with one invitation he was suddenly a presence in my life again."
Or had he been there all along?
Like the chair he made that I could never bring myself to sell.
"When a relationship dies, do we ever really give up the ghost?"
Or are we forever haunted by the spirits of relationships past?
Why did you not introduce me to that Sean?
"He's nobody, just a guy I used to fuck."
"He's nobody, just a guy I used to fuck."
And why have you not told this nobody that you are with a somebody now?
What am I supposed to say?
"Hi, this is my lesbian lover, and P.S."
", I'm done with dick ?"
I was talking about our relationship.
Is that what this is all about?
How many men have you been with?
How many women have you been with?
Have you been with more than men?
Why are we even talking about this?
Why are you so afraid to talk?
I cannot just turn it on and off.
"After all, I'm not a man."
"That night, Charlotte found herself haunted by dust ruffles, ducks and Bunny."
"Your mother decorated this entire apartment, didn't she?"
"No, it's like we live in the Museum of Natural Ugliness"
"If we're really serious about making a fresh start with our marriage and making this our home it should reflect our taste, shouldn't it?"
"Darling, Mother spent an awful lot of time and money on this place."
"So, maybe I should just have a chat with her."
"Let me talk to her, it might go easier."
"Tomorrow, when she comes over for brunch I will sit her down and say that this is simply not our, slash, your taste."
The animals have got to go.
"Up and at 'em, George McFaddam."
Trey was in no condition to talk to anyone.
"Charlotte, telephone my house and tell Geneva to bring over some broth and my overnight case."
You have a busy week at the gallery.
I might as well stay in the guest room until Trey's recovered.
"Charlotte, what's this mallard doing here?"
"Since I wasn't going to risk an awkward public confrontation at Aidan's opening, I wanted to at least make a gesture."
"Some small way of saying, Thank you for inviting me."
For being braver than I could have been.
And for at least suggesting that we can be friends.
There was no sign of him.
"In the mahogany bar, the wood floors the carved ceiling."
The whole place looked and felt just like Aidan.
I was just in the neighborhood.
I just couldn't resist a little sneak preview.
"No, I just I won't be able to come to the opening so, I wanted to thank Aidan, you know, for inviting me, so it's a mulberry bush."
"You know, 'cause the bar is on Mulberry Street."
"Only Aidan didn't exactly invite you, I did."
"Cause I thought Miranda might feel more comfortable if she knew you were gonna be here, so"
"So, then Aidan didn't invite me?"
"That night, I wasn't the only one who was haunted."
"At this point, I'm almost hoping there is a ghost."
You say that like it's an either or proposition.
"I know, I'm sorry for making you come over."
"I just needed another person here, you know?"
'Cause the cat's an unreliable witness.
"I checked the rarely invoked haunted house clause of the best friend contract, you're completely covered."
"Meanwhile, across the park Charlotte, haunted by Bunny's decision to spend the night couldn't sleep either."
I remembered I had some Vicks in my bag.
It's the best thing for a cold.
But I already gave him some NyQuil.
NyQuil doesn't cure anything except consciousness.
Don't you think I should do that?
"If anyone does it, it should be me."
You're trying to break up the phlegm.
You don't know what you're doing.
"I'm sorry, but this just isn't going to work."
"Trey and I are back together, and this is our house."
And we will redecorate it as we see fit.
"No more plaid, no more duck decoys."
From now on there can only be one lady of the house.
"I've been in this house far longer than you, my dear."
"And unlike you, I never left."
"Believe me, the decoys may come and go but I'm going to be here forever."
"Come on, baby, open up, it's me, Sean."
How did you even get in?
Your security code's still the same.
"How about it, can I come in?"
"No, you can't be here right now."
"Come on, I got hard just walking up your stairs."
You got another guy in here or something?
That's Maybe I could come in and you two could make me a sandwich or something.
I don't think tonight's gonna be good for us.
"Come on, I'm only in town for just a I'm sorry."
"You get away from the door, motherfucker"
And with that Maria released Samantha's ghost and confronted Samantha.
You let men come to your door like this in the middle of the night?
"Let it go, it's all in the past."
It's at your door in the middle of the night.
"All right, this might come as a shock to you, but I used to have sex with men."
This man was here for nothing but sex.
"Yes, which I used to enjoy and haven't had much of since I got into this relationship."
It's tedious and the sex is dwindling.
"So, from what I've heard, yes."
If you have something to say to me
I have nothing to say to you.
I am fresh out of things to say to you.
All we ever do is talk.
The talking in our relationship has replaced the fucking in our fucking relationship
Now he won't know what the plant's supposed to mean.
It's like I plant bombed him.
"So, how did the bar look?"
I'm trying to be happy for him.
"He's got his own bar, his own life, his own Jessica."
"And I'm still here, you know?"
"In the same apartment, doing the same job, living the same life."
"But you have something that no one else has, you have a ghost."
But at least Big's the friendly ghost.
"Aidan, on the other hand I'm just afraid the way I treated him is gonna haunt me the rest of my life."
There's nothing I can do about it.
He wouldn't have invited you if it wasn't okay with Aidan.
Do you ever think that you might still have feelings for Steve?
"I left Miranda's early, got some sleep and in the light of day it felt like all my ghosts had disappeared."
And I saw the world exactly as it was.
"A few days later, Trey felt better, too."
Especially since Bunny moved out of the guest room and back into her own apartment.
"Up and at 'em, George I brought some Oh, dear."
I brought some muffins for breakfast.
Charlotte didn't know whether it was their making love or their making love on a bed without a dust ruffle that had offended her.
"But either way, their sexorcism ensured Bunny never haunted their home again unless expressly invited."
"While downtown, a dearly departed spirit suddenly reappeared."
"It's been two days, I was worried."
Maria made one last ditch effort to give Samantha what she thought she needed.
You bought me a strap on?
Since she couldn't bring herself to admit she wasn't capable of being in a relationship she simply said.
I guess we could give it a try.
"That night, despite all my fears and reservations I let Miranda and Samantha talk me into going to the opening of Scout."
Who are all these attractive people?
"Getting your groove on, doing the robot?"
Fucking Maria with a strap on.
"She fucked me, I fucked her."
"With all the fucking and talking, I had no idea men had to work so hard."
"How does a strap on work, exactly?"
Could we not have the strap on conversation right now?
This night is hard enough as it is.
Was it the strap on that broke the relationship's back or just yours?
Maria thinks I have intimacy issues.
"I tried, I really did, but I'm not a relationship person."
"I told her from the start, didn't I?"
Then she has to go and fall in love with me.
Would it be bad to have a martini with my muscle relaxant or bad in a good way?
Are you operating heavy machinery this evening?
Where's the bar in this bar?
"When you see a ghost, you just know it."
The hairs on the back of your neck stand up.
I don't even know what that was.
I don't know who that was.
"Does he look better, or have I just been with a woman too long?"
"I'm going home, I don't know why I came."
"Come on, let me buy you ladies a free drink."
I'll meet you at the bar.
I think I think you did good.
'Cause I never would've done this if it wasn't for you.
This whole thing was your idea.
You always told me I should start my own bar.
"I just never thought that I could, so thanks."
"And just like that, Miranda gave up the ghost."
"Come on, let's get you drunk."
"An hour later, since my ghost hadn't reappeared I decided to sneak out the side door for some cake and a smoke."
"You're not seriously smoking that, are you?"
Is that all you could carry?
Now I can't eat my cake.
Now you got your fingers all in it.
So now you want the cake?
"Okay, lady, you take the cake."
You have frosting on your lip.
I thought you were the silent partner.
I had accepted and released him but now I was more haunted than ever.
Because what I felt out there was no ghost it was real.
Despite the fact there are over million people on the island of Manhattan there are times when you still feel shipwrecked and alone.
"Times when even the most resourceful survivor will feel the need to put a message in a bottle, or on an answering machine."
"Remember, every movement has a meaning."
I wondered what it meant that I wanted to talk to my ex boyfriend again.
I've been making faux calls to Aidan.
"F A U X, where you dial but you have no idea what to say if he answers."
"You mean, you call and you hang up?"
I don't know why I'm telling you.
"Carrie, tell them what you told me."
That I'm not going to your African dance class again or that you can't keep a secret?
I think I want him back.
"First, you have to accept that after what happened, he might not want to hear it."
But he needs to lose the turquoise rings and the tummy.
"At that thing last week, he looked disturbingly good."
"That's not why I want him back, I just miss him."
"Okay, you need a safe approach, in case he rejects you."
I don't believe in e mail.
I prefer calling and hanging up.
"You gotta get online, if only for the porn."
Would you please stop sending me those?
"I can't get e mail just to write to Aidan, that's pathetic."
"It's not just e mail, you can shop online."
"Okay, I know what to do."
"Don't call, don't e mail just show up at his furniture store wearing these."
And why are we carrying them around?
They were sent to me as a promotional thing.
Do nipples have a bad rap?
"Those girls are either tweaking, or they're wearing these."
I want to see how they work.
"Now that, I'd like to see."
"I'm not certain, but I have a feeling my boobs were just insulted."
We have secretly replaced Miranda's nipples with rubber ones.
"Okay, that's it, I want my nipples back."
"The next day, sans nipples Miranda's cardio put my cardio to shame."
She was training for the marathon.
Running wasn't the only thing getting her heart rate up.
You sure you're in the right group?
But the thing is we never get any cute guys in this group.
The cute guys are in the seven minute mile group.
"I'm the cutest of the slow guys, is what you're saying?"
Have you run the marathon before?
We should train during the week.
Are there runs during the week?
I meant just the two of us.
"Miranda was thrilled, but she still wasn't sure if he was interested in anything more than a running buddy."
"And uptown, Charlotte's marathon redecoration continued."
I can't believe I ever questioned this wallpaper.
I guess we're done with this room.
Time to move on to the study.
There's one room in every marriage that forces the question.
How long do we want it to be just the two of us?
"It's right off our bedroom, so Well What do you want to do with this room?"
It could be a good room for a B A
I think we already have enough bathrooms.
Trey and Charlotte were finally on the same page.
And the page had a baby on it.
"Meanwhile, Samantha went shopping, nipples blazing and picked up a 'cabernet and an 'Harvard MBA."
"No, we can't retract it, because that's what you said."
Warren Dreyfous was a founder of the communications strategy firm that made the Exxon oil spill an incident rather than a debacle.
"Next time, talk to me before you talk to the press."
"About talking on the phone, or staring at my nipples?"
"That night, I tried to compose my first e mail."
"A witty, yet sexy, yet sensitive note to Aidan."
"And across town, Samantha was getting some male, as well."
"As a lover, Warren was fantastic."
But as a communications strategist he made one major mistake.
"Samantha, does your gina wina want a little visit from my mister mister?"
"It's not what he said, it's how he said it, in baby talk."
How can they think it's sexy?
It's like putting ketchup on prime rib.
"I know, it's such a shame, because this guy is hot."
I finally had to sit on his face to shut him up.
"You know, some men use baby talk to avoid intimacy."
While others simply choose not to respond to your e mail.
Don't you think that maybe it's a wee bit small?
Trey and I are trying to have a baby.
Don't you think that maybe you should wait awhile?
You guys just got back together.
I'm the oldest woman I know who doesn't have a baby.
The oldest married woman who wants one.
"If that's what you want, I'm very happy for you."
"And I promise, I won't become one of those mothers who can only talk about Diaper Genies."
What the hell is a Diaper Genie?
Someone you hire to change a kid's diaper?
"Tricia Watson was one of those hip moms for whom Barneys would always be stores, not dinosaurs."
Cliff said you and Trey are back together.
Trey and I are trying to get pregnant.
You and Cliff should come over for dinner.
We just redecorated our dining room.
We haven't even used it yet.
"I'd love to, but try finding a sitter for three kids under"
I can't believe I'm with three kids.
I invited the Watsons over for dinner Tuesday.
"Charlotte, with no kids decided it was time to get serious."
"The next day, I worked on a little piece I was calling."
"Thirty six hours, and still no response from Aidan."
The Indians had to wait up to six months for a response.
It took me six months to get the message that I wanted to be with Aidan.
And now I couldn't wait another minute.
Are all these improvements in communication really helping us communicate?
In matters of love do actions really speak louder than words?
Why won't you respond to my e mail?
I was just asking if you ever got my e mail.
I think I got it and deleted it.
"I get so much damn junk mail, if I don't know an address I have the opposite problem."
I've received two e mails total.
"One from Miranda, and one welcoming me to AOL."
"Just, you know how to use the different features and stuff, and welcome."
The one I The one to you.
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that you and Steve and Miranda and me could go out sometime.
"You know, just like as a you know, a fun group thing."
"Okay, great, so I'll set it up?"
Which led to sex which led her to believe that Marathon Man could be more than a running buddy.
Did you get my e mail about our double whatever it is?
"So far, not impressed with the e mail."
Why would I go out with Steve?
You're not going out with him.
"You're going as my airbag, in case there's an impact."
Steve's going as Aidan's air bag.
I don't want him to get the wrong impression.
We slept together after our run.
Did he live up to his nickname?
"It was good, except he kind of licked my butt."
It was more localized than that.
"Wait a minute, are we talking tuchis lingus?"
And I thought it was weird.
"If the guy is willing, why not?"
I never had a guy do the TL on me.
"One time, it almost happened, but I got the feeling he just lost his way."
"Okay, I'm definitely in the slow sexual group if even Charlotte is open to this."
There's something happening with men and the ass.
"The last few guys I've been with have been much more eager to attend to it you know, digitally."
How did they get the message that the ass is now on the menu?
"I bet there's one loud mouthed guy who found some woman who loved it and told everybody, Women love this"
Who's the woman who loved it?
Don't knock it until you try it.
Maybe I shouldn't have pulled away so fast.
Am I out of the ass loop forever?
I can't bring myself to ask for it.
"You don't have to ask for it, just lean into it."
But then do I have to reciprocate?
I would never do it back to them.
"That night, Charlotte performed a more traditional wifely duty."
She cooked dinner for her husband and their guests.
Trish is amazed that anyone cooks.
"Trish has three kids, which keeps her kind of busy."
I don't want to sit next to the lady.
"We can rearrange, if you want."
Not going to be much in the sports area.
Not all little boys have to play sports.
Don't talk to me like you talk to the kids.
He won't go out without 'em.
Don't talk about him like that.
Don't you talk to me like that.
"That night, Trey and Charlotte didn't have sex."
"And they didn't have sex the next night, either."
"This time, inaction was speaking louder than words."
"This guy from pest control comes over and sticks a few dead ones on a tape strip I, on the other hand, was full of words."
"So I say to him, What are they?"
"He says, Lady, I don't know, that's why I'm sending them to the lab."
"And I'm thinking, This is New York, this is the pest guy."
He doesn't know what it is and that ain't good
"I gotta take a leak, I'm laughing too hard."
"What the hell, I'm man enough."
Do I get a say in this?
We're already partners in the bar.
So apparently Aidan needed an airbag in the bathroom.
"You know, I think I'm okay."
"You mean, you think you're over him."
"No, I think you can go."
"The thing is, if you don't leave now then we're gonna have to end the night together."
Hug and share cabs according to neighborhood.
And then I won't have any time alone with him.
And can you take Steve with you?
Thank you for walking me home.
You live four blocks from the restaurant.
It's the least I could do.
I think I want to get back together.
"Fuck, I was afraid you were going to say something like that."
"I was willing to try the friendship thing, but I can't do the relationship thing."
You put your hand on my hand.
I was trying to make you comfortable.
You seemed so nervous telling that bug story.
"Oh, well then I guess I should Goodnight."
"Miranda didn't answer her phone, so I left a desperate message and started to send her a desperate e mail."
I was just about to call you.
I was IM ing Marathon Man.
Will your tuchis be wanting some lingus?
"Listen, if things work out between him and me we never had that conversation."
I guess you'll be having dessert after all.
What happened to my airbag outside the restaurant?
I wasn't going to kiss him.
He said he just wanted friendship.
"No, just step away from the computer."
"No, I'm going to go back there."
"Pace yourself, send him an e mail or something."
"No, he'll just say that he doesn't want to see me, but he does."
"His words said no, but his kiss said yes."
That's the defense invoked by date rapists.
I know he still feels it.
"When men attempt bold gestures, it's generally considered romantic."
"When women do it, it's often considered desperate or psycho."
I was hoping to prove I was neither.
You haven't been out here since I went up?
"See, I I think No, I feel fairly certain that there is still something between us."
"I had a nice time tonight with you, I did."
But I just want to leave it at that.
Can I come up and talk to you for a few minutes?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Because it's not a good time.
I know that you're probably scared.
This is a whole new thing.
"And it's not just because you look so good, you do, and you should know that."
"But I lie in bed at night, and I think about us."
And I think about you holding me.
"Samantha, I love your titty witties."
As I was wishing I had said nothing Samantha decided she had to say something.
"You're a great fuck, but I don't need the baby talk."
"You don't have to call these my titty witties, these are my breasts."
And you don't have to say anything about them.
"It's just sex, and it's fine."
Would you please come out of there?
Can we talk about this like adults?
"Okay, you can call them titty witties."
I got an early day tomorrow.
We were having such a nice time.
Samantha realized that she wore the nipples and attracted a big baby.
"And speaking of babies, Charlotte and Trey still were not."
I ordered that a week ago.
"They needed time to engrave, and I totally forgot."
We had each other and then we had you.
Do you not want a baby anymore?
We pretty much stopped trying after the Watsons came over.
Kids don't even want to sit by me.
I want to sit next to you.
"I knew Cliff and Tricia when they were first married, they were so in love."
Maybe if we only have one child.
Then Trey told the lie that all parents to be have to tell themselves in order to procreate.
Even though the whole experience had them a little rattled that night Trey and Charlotte made love and possibly a baby.
"And downtown, Miranda seemingly had her communication problem licked."
And she felt like she should do something in return.
I don't want to do that
"Why didn't you say you weren't interested, before you were talking into my ass?"
"This time, we didn't need any words."
You want to do this to make up for the past?
I've mentally kicked your butt all over Manhattan.
"I still love you, I just wish that I could be your girlfriend again."
I need to think about that.
"His actions said he still loved me, or maybe he just missed me or maybe he needed closure."
"The next morning, due to sheer embarrassment Miranda got what she needed."
A running buddy who pushed her into the nine minute mile group.
And I still had no response from Aidan.
"Okay, let's give it a shot."
"No, I promised Pete I'd take him for a walk."
You wanna go for a walk?
Once Aidan and I were back together it seemed like nothing had ever happened to break us apart.
A little machine with a big message.
Big called while Aidan and I were making love.
He could keep going after that?
"Never mind him, how'd you do?"
And I haven't worked that hard at anything since my SATs.
"No, we just went to sleep."
"And when I woke up, Aidan was on the other side of the bed."
Usually he sleeps right next to me.
"You know, like, right here and I just, I get in his little nook."
"Maybe, or maybe he'll never forget what happened and every time the phone rings he'll think that it's Big calling to start affair number two."
I was just hoping that we could just start fresh and now we're gonna have to talk about it.
"What are you gonna do, sit Aidan down and explain about Big?"
Unless Hallmark makes a Sorry I Cheated card.
No one wants to hear about their lover's past lovers.
"What happened was in the past, leave it there."
I have to talk about it.
"Here you go, this is yours."
I'll pay you a million dollars.
I'm thinking about quitting my job.
Did you get an offer from a better gallery?
I've been driving myself crazy lately just trying to get everything done and Trey suggested
He mentioned that maybe I might quit.
"And I mean, really, I have just been driving myself crazy."
What has the gallery ever done for me?
But there's so much more I could do with my life.
"Soon I'll be pregnant, and that'll be huge."
"Plus, I'm redecorating the apartment and I always wanted to take Indian cooking classes and sometimes I'll walk by one of those Color Me Mine pottery places and I'll see a woman having just a lovely afternoon glazing a bowl."
And I wanted to volunteer at Trey's hospital.
And help raise money for the new Pediatric AIDS wing.
"The cooking and the AIDS stuff is great, but Color Me Mine, sweetie If I was walking by and I saw you in there I'd just keep on walking."
You sure you're not just having a bad work week?
"I'm quitting, that's what I want to do, yep."
"Well, be damn sure before you get off the Ferris wheel because the women waiting to get on are perky, and ruthless."
You seem to have a lot of opinions today.
I'm telling you just forget it ever happened.
"Later that day, I got to thinking about relationships and partial lobotomies."
Two seemingly different ideas that might be perfect together like chocolate and peanut butter.
Think how much easier it would all be if there was some swift surgical procedure to whisk away all the ugly memories and mistakes and leave only the fun trips and special holidays.
"But until that day arrives, what to do?"
Rely on the same old needlepoint philosophy of forgive and forget ?
And even if a couple can manage the forgiveness has any ever really conquered the forgetness?
"Can you ever really forgive, if you can't forget?"
"To Samantha Jones, some things were unforgivable."
And taking someone else's cab was right at the top of her list.
"West h and h Avenue, please."
I hope you enjoy the ride.
And in a far less friendly bed uptown I was even farther from the nook.
"Yet, I still wasn't sure, maybe I was overreacting."
You don't have to go to the gym right now.
Do you want me to get all soft again?
Give me a good morning kiss.
You might want to brush your teeth first.
You were so judgmental at the coffee shop yesterday.
You think I'm one of those women.
One of those women we hate who just works until she gets married.
It's an in the morning response.
The women's movement is supposed to be about choice.
"And if I choose to quit my job, that is my choice."
"Jesus Christ, I haven't even had coffee yet."
It's my life and my choice.
"This isn't about me, this is your stuff."
I'm dripping all over my bathroom and you're calling me judgmental.
If you have a problem with quitting your job maybe you should take it up with your husband.
"See, there it is, your husband."
There's nothing wrong with having a husband
And stop saying Charlotte like that.
I am quitting my job to make my life better and do something worthwhile like have a baby and cure AIDS.
Just don't be too disappointed if all you wind up with is a pretty ceramic mug with Trey's name on it.
I'm interviewing girls to replace me and I really need you to get behind my choice.
I don't have time for this.
I have to go to work.
Some of us still have to go to work.
"When in a hostile situation some women, like Charlotte, confront it head on while others"
I ran down to the Korean.
"Will you help me patch up, buddy?"
I got a big tense meeting with my editor in about an hour.
It feels like a two patch day.
You notice how much better I'm doing this time?
I think I finally kicked that bad habit.
"Now I'm practically perfect, don't you think?"
I was just making sure it was on good and tight.
Are you mad at me or something?
Why would I be mad at you?
You just fucking let it sit in there?
I'm just a little pissed off because of work.
"I got to strip these pieces, the chemicals are toxic"
I can't get anybody to watch Pete.
"Come on, dog walking is not your favorite thing to do."
"You love Pete, I love Pete."
That's just the kind of girlfriend I am.
How 'bout I take my tall drink of water out to dinner tonight?
Someplace super nice where the milk is fresh.
I was gonna hook up with some of my buddies over at Steve's bar.
"Is it a night with the guys, or can girlfriends crash?"
"You can come, don't come whatever, do what you like."
"No, you go have fun with the guys."
Charlotte called and I was drying my hair my whole body is fucked up because of the marathon.
"I'm sorry, can I do something?"
It hurts to even hold the phone.
She can't move and I'm just I'm worried that it's too late for me to cancel my meeting.
I'll go check on Miranda for you.
"You are a great, great boyfriend."
"I mean it, you're the best."
Twenty minutes later Miranda's neck had gone from bad to worse.
"No, it's Aidan, Carrie sent me."
"No, don't come in, I'm naked"
My neck pulled again and this is the only way I felt comfortable.
"Okay, don't get up, I'm coming in."
"No, don't come in, I'm fine"
"Just relax, darling, I'm looking the other way."
I'm going to lift you up.
"Nothing I haven't seen before, okay."
"Nice smell, that's the April Fresh stuff, right?"
"All right, put your There you go."
"Let's get you up now, on three."
Snug as a bug in a rug.
It seemed every aspiring gallerina in New York wanted Charlotte's job.
She was determined to find the perfect replacement.
"Someone bright, someone smart someone like Charlotte."
"In Art History, minor in Finance."
Career objectives: To own my own gallery.
"Oh, my God, that is amazing."
I think I had the same objective on my first r??sum??.
"I found I loved it here so much, that it felt like my gallery."
"I probably shouldn't tell you this with a line of people out there, but you're hired."
"So, do you have any questions?"
Why are you leaving this fantastic job?
"I'm married, and we're planning on a baby."
Also I'm on the board of the Lenox Hill Pediatric AIDS Foundation.
She just couldn't bring herself to tell the girl that her new r??sum?? objective would read.
"Wife, mother, and part time bowl glazer."
"That night, I decided to interrupt Guys' Night to give Aidan a quick thank you for helping Miranda kiss."
Not only are you great to me but you're great to my friends as well.
Who's a better boyfriend than you?
I was up to three peanuts.
You think you're such hot stuff?
"Yeah, Shayna here is teaching me how to play jacks with the peanuts."
Can I get you a drink?
I don't want to interrupt the night with the guys.
"Man, the guys blew me off at the last minute."
"So, I came down here to hang out with my buddy, Steve."
"And Steve I'm sorry, where's Steve?"
"It's kinda slow, so Steve went to get a burrito."
Shayna and I are looking out for the joint.
"So, Miranda says that you were amazing."
He took her to the chiropractor.
"We got us a nice guy, here."
No work or running for a week.
And she has to wear one of those foam collars.
Can you excuse us for a second?
"Listen, I don't have to work tomorrow so, come on over if you want."
"It was nice to meet you, Shayna."
", it became very clear that I was being punished for my big mistake."
That cowl neck look is on the way out.
I had to sleep sitting up like the Elephant Man.
I brought you bagels to cheer you up.
Aidan never came over last night.
"He said he would, but he didn't."
And I called him this morning.
He said he thought that come over meant today not last night.
You and your bullshit cheer me up bagels.
They're just a decoy so you could talk about Aidan.
You didn't even bring cream cheese.
"It's bad enough you send your boyfriend to help me but now, the bullshit bagels"
Are you saying you don't want one?
"If you fell or something I would never send my boyfriend to help you and yes, I know, I don't have a boyfriend."
Aidan's better in a crisis than I am.
I can't even remember your cream cheese.
"Your boyfriend saw me naked on the floor, lying on a bathmat"
"All right, I get it, I'm sorry."
I will never send a boyfriend to do my job again.
Lf I still even have a boyfriend.
I think he's having an affair with a waitress at Scout.
Just because you cheated on him does not mean he would cheat on you.
"If he hasn't, it's just a matter of time."
"Yeah, he's the good guy and I'm the bad guy."
"And the bad guy just has to take it, right?"
I mean you should've seen the way he was acting in front of me.
He's torturing me for what I did to him.
I wish I knew the name of that cab driver.
I'd send him a bottle of wine or something.
"Yeah, speaking of wild it's getting a little too wild down there, might be time for a wax."
I have three errant hairs and the asshole thinks I'm George of the Jungle.
You should see the bush on him.
I need a weed whacker just to find his dick.
Could you please keep it down?
We're on the Upper East Side.
"We have to run to Helga the hot waxer every other week, but them?"
How would they like it if we told them to shape their hedge
"We are talking about gardening, right?"
Don't get me started on his back hair.
"Okay, please, wait a second, Pete has to go."
Why are you even walking this mongrel?
Because I'm proving to my boyfriend that I am trustworthy and loving.
"And kindly, do not take your anger out on Pete."
"So, watching his dog take a dump is going to make the memory of Big fade away?"
I don't know that anything happened with the waitress.
How much longer are you gonna punish yourself?
Until I'm back in the nook.
You may never get back in the nook.
"I know it's true, but don't say it."
"I'm not a dog expert, but is that normal?"
He must be sick or something.
"Honey, I love you, but this is not my scene."
You're not gonna just leave me here?
"Don't walk, you're not done, honey."
It was right about then I wondered just how much shit was I willing to put up with for my mistake?
Poor Pete's poo poo platter continued for so many blocks I got worried and decided it was time to take him home.
"Here, your dog got sick, I'm leaving."
And she just happened to be there with coffee?
Why don't you just fuck her?
Then we can both be bad.
Do you want to come in?
I'm too pissed to come in.
I hate that he calls here.
Nothing's happening or will ever happen.
"You have to know that, right?"
I would never do that to you again.
I don't want you to see him ever again.
"Not the same way you are, but he is."
You can't keep punishing me and I can't keep punishing me.
I made a mistake and I am sorry.
And I know that you can't forget what happened but I hope that you can forgive me.
You had a lot of nerve telling me to get a wax.
"If you were in Aruba, the natives could bead your back."
"Every time I blow you, I feel like I'm flossing."
Is there anything I can do to make you forgive me?
And Brad got a lesson he never forgot.
Look how much bigger my dick looks
"And soon, Charlotte's last day came."
Number seven should go on the north wall.
I think it would be better on the south side.
You're what do you know about life?
I've been working my whole life.
"If it's any consolation, my mother worked all the time."
It would've been nice to have her home more.
Don't forget to set the alarms.
You're not going to finish the day?
"Charlotte left her past to pursue her new life objectives be a good mother, cure AIDS and prove Miranda wrong."
You better move my meetings till the end of the week.
And for the first time in her life Miranda learned the joys of cooking and of not working.
"Of course, she'd have to go back eventually just to prove Charlotte wrong."
And as for Aidan he and I weren't quite back to where we were.
"We might never be there again but we were in a new place, a more honest place."
"And somehow, over time I had made my way back into the nook."
"One frazzled Friday, four overbooked girlfriends came from four different directions."
The East Side the West Side Park Avenue and Samantha.
"It was the ultimate New York power lunch, also known as the power catch up."
I can sum up my life in one breath.
"Work, work, Au Bon Pain, work."
"Okay, let's see Aidan, Aidan, this pimple, Aidan."
Maybe we don't need an hour.
"Charlotte, I can't believe you made this sandwich."
"I love you not working, you can be my wife."
"I thought I'd have more free time, but redecorating is very stressful."
Did you know there are over different kinds of dimmers?
Remember back when the economy was good and we had a table?
I need these seven just to get in Aidan's building.
"Yeah, but I always make him come to my place."
He buys that two in one shampoo.
"Does Aidan have your keys now, too?"
"No, that's the opposite of Big."
It took me six months to give my cleaning lady a key.
I happen to have the key to a lasting relationship right here.
I got it on the corner from a guy.
Whose legs bend back that far?
It's like sex for the boneless.
"See, that's what I love about this guy Nick I'm seeing."
He's the wrestling coach at NYU and he's like an extra strength rubber band.
"My congregants, please refer to Position in your prayer books."
"' That night, I came home to find Aidan in the most shocking position of all."
"Meet my new George Foreman lean, mean, fat reducing grilling machine."
"What are you doing back there, ladybird?"
If giving a man the keys to your apartment means unlocking the door to home cooking and great sex why were so many independent women
My computer just crashed right in the middle I just
It always works on my computer.
I got rid of it in a feng shui attack.
"Oh, my God, I want to kill myself."
"This thing's faking you out, that's all."
"You don't know what you're doing, just stop"
"Two meltdowns later we rushed my 'laptop, in my 'pashmina, to Tekserve."
Can you please not do that?
I tried a few home remedies.
But then he did something to it.
Tell him what you did to it.
I hit the Control Alt Delete.
Tell me exactly what happened right before you crashed.
I was typing and then he came over and he kissed me and then I got the bomb.
"Is this funny, do you think that this is funny?"
When was the last time you backed up your work?
Anything else before we go in?
There was a mean little man who popped up and he had X's where his eyes should be.
And his tongue was hanging out the side of his mouth.
"You Sad Mac'd, you should've told me that before."
"Could be your motherboard, the guts of your computer."
"We'll keep it here for a couple of days, run some tests."
I'll call you if we find anything.
"Oh, God, Miranda, I'm freaking out."
What if everything I've ever written is gone?
When was the last time you backed up?
"You know, no one talks about backing up."
You've never used that expression with me before.
"But apparently, everybody's secretly running home at night and backing up their work."
I'm at the hospital in Philadelphia.
My mom had a heart attack.
And you let me go on about my stupid computer?
"That's very upsetting, I've been through that."
How could you go to Philadelphia without telling me?
I had six minutes to get the train.
I didn't know how bad it was till I got here.
They keep telling us different things.
"Although, she did open her eyes just long enough to veto my lipstick."
Can I do anything to help?
I'll come there and keep you company.
You can't use a cell phone in the hospital.
Now my sister's mad at me.
"Meanwhile, Charlotte's afternoon was filled with ovulating and decorating."
She was days into her cycle and three rooms into her lighting project.
She had become a bona fide dimmer expert.
Samantha called in a bona fide positions expert who came fully equipped.
Turns out a half nelson was very much like Position
"One half nelson, one full orgasm."
"It's me, I'm sorry to wake you."
And then they called and said she was crashing.
"And by the time we got back, she had died."
"I just wish we hadn't gone home, you know?"
"Nobody wanted to, but they kept telling us we ought to get some sleep."
"I'm sure that she knew, on some level that you were with her."
The funeral's on Tuesday and I don't have anything to wear.
I didn't think I would be going to a funeral while I was here.
"I'll be there, so I can I'll bring you something from your apartment."
I'm just gonna go out and buy a shitty black dress I'll never wear again.
I'd be happy to do it.
Do you know when the funeral is?
I'd like to go if I can.
"Where have you been, and where's Miranda?"
"Her mother had a heart attack yesterday and she died, early this morning."
I just felt so awful for her and I just I didn't know what to say to her and
"You know Miranda, she was trying to be so strong but she sounded so alone."
"And I just kept saying all the wrong things, I think."
I guess the first thing we should do is send some flowers.
"Or muffins, what do you think?"
"Flowers are fine, just tell me who to send the check to."
"After breakfast, Charlotte showed her support for Miranda by becoming the Martha Stewart of death."
I want the clear cellophane and the navy ribbon.
"Samantha, have you called Miranda yet?"
She thinks it'd be faster for us to take the train to Philadelphia and I agree.
I thought we were just sending flowers.
Of course we're going to the funeral and you should call her.
I think she'd really like to hear from you.
What am I gonna say to her?
"You could say, I'm so sorry for your loss."
"I love you, I'm here for you."
"May she rest in peace, I'm so sorry you lost"
"Fine, I'll call her, good bye."
"In times of sorrow, some people have trouble reaching out."
Samantha wasn't one of those people.
But today something was just out of reach.
Just hang on one more second.
"Keep hanging on, stay with me."
And when none of those worked they went back to Old Faithful.
Just keep doing exactly what you're doing.
I gotta pick up my stuff at the cleaners by
"I want you to make it very clear to the Philadelphia florist Tasteful, all white."
"The Casablanca lilies, the calla lilies and the Phalaenopsis."
These flowers will be the centerpiece on the church altar.
"It's important that they represent us, don't you agree?"
"I don't know, I'm not even listening."
"What do you mean, lost ?"
"I mean, I just spent the last two hours fucking with no finale."
Sometimes you just can't get there.
"I'll admit I have had to polish myself off once or twice, but yes."
"To a party, I make it my business to come."
"See, I've been a no show on more than one occasion."
Sex can still be great without an orgasm.
That is such a crock of shit.
You've got plenty of orgasms under your belt.
You can have them on the bottom?
"All right, now you're just showing off."
Sweetie I'm sure it will pop up when you least expect it.
I read this article about a woman who's having orgasms around the clock.
It was like she had used them all up or something.
That's the meanest thing you've ever said to me.
"Meanwhile in Philadelphia, Miranda realized she needed a shitty black bra to go with her shitty black dress."
Can I help you find something?
"No, I'm looking for this in in black."
You don't look like a to me.
I've been a my whole life.
I think I know what size I am.
There is no way that I'm a .
From the age of Miranda had a strict no visitors policy in the dressing room.
Let's see how that's working out.
"Although her mother never observed it, and neither did Lucille."
I just said that I didn't need any help.
"You say you don't want help, but you were picking out the wrong size."
I think that I can adjust my bra straps by myself.
Would you please get your hands off of my breasts?
I think I know what's best.
I think that I know what's best for me
Suddenly Miranda realized she would never have a fight with her mother again.
"And there, behind the curtain, when no one was looking Miranda found a kind of support that actually fit her."
"Damn, you're always sneaking up on me."
It's a lot more fun than your old one.
"It's got this handle, so it's like a little purse."
And I got you one of these Zip drives so you can start backing up your work now.
"I don't even know how to use that and I don't need it, I have my own system."
I'm not ready for a new computer.
I'm still waiting to hear back about my old one.
My whole life was on that computer.
I'm not a part of any of this.
You don't want me to go to the funeral.
"I feel like I gave you my keys, what more do you want?"
"Great, now I can get into your front door."
How do I get into there?
"I'm sorry, but I've been taking care of myself for a really long time."
"You may not like it, but this is how I deal with things."
"So you can do whatever you want with that computer, all right?"
"Meanwhile, Samantha was troubleshooting her own laptop."
She was determined to just relax unwind and let the rest of the world fall away.
I'm picking up bagels for the train ride.
And have you called Miranda yet?
I'm whole wheat and I haven't called her because I don't want to bother her.
I told you I'd be doing that all day today.
"By nightfall, Samantha called off the search party."
Somewhere in the city of lost dreams and missing persons Samantha's orgasm remained at large.
"The next morning, my own search party called with news of a breakthrough."
"I'm Number P, you have my computer."
And here's what we could recover from your hard drive.
Any of that look familiar to you?
Can you please tell me why this happened in the first place?
"Sometimes these things, they just crash."
We can replace your motherboard but you have to get yourself a backup system.
"Pick out a Zip drive, start saving."
"Next time, you won't lose everything."
"It's me, the girl who doesn't back up."
This is my attempt to breathe and reboot.
Are you smiling at all over there?
Okay I'm just on my way to Philly and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
We're gonna run into stuff that's hard.
That's why I was trying to help.
I know that but if you start helping me and then I get used to having that help
No good can come of that.
"I mean, then what happens when, you know you're not around one day?"
You could be out of town or be busy or
Then I guess we'd be a couple of Sad Macs.
"Just a hop, a skip, a cab, a metroliner and another cab away."
I'm not gonna find my orgasm in this town.
But everybody else is very concerned about me because I'm here alone.
I didn't realize I needed a date for my mother's funeral.
"My sister and her husband want me to third wheel with them down the aisle God forbid that I should walk it alone because that would be the real tragedy, right?"
There's a single year old woman walking behind it.
That was not one of the things I told you to say.
"Hi, I'm Charlotte, we spoke on the phone."
I just wanted to say again how sorry I am.
And to make sure that everything worked out with the flowers.
"In fact, there they are now."
I think now we know what worth of glitter looks like.
"There are no explanations, no answers."
No magic words to soothe us.
"You're a spiritual leader, can't you make something up?"
"Those flowers were supposed to say: We're so sorry, we love you."
"so many wonderful stories about her from her daughter Betsy and her husband, David her son John and his wife, Miranda her daughter Catherine Did he just say No spiritual stuff and he can't keep the family tree straight?"
"Sara, Alexandra, Nathan, and little Emily."
"After the burial John and his wife, Miranda, invite you back to their home."
Directions can be found as you exit the sanctuary.
"Finally, Samantha found the release she really needed."
She cried for everything she couldn't say and for things she didn't even know she felt.
There's the kind of support you ask for and a kind of support you don't ask for.
And then there's the kind that just shows up.
"After all, computers crash, people die relationships fall apart."
The best we can do is breathe and reboot.
And when that fails a little gizmo called a Zip drive can provide a surprising amount of comfort.
If you can learn to let him
"For most New Yorkers, Manhattan is the center of the civilized world."
"But for a privileged few, Manhattan is merely a place to kill time between weekends at their fashionably rustic New York country homes."
"Wow, yeah, the place looks great."
I was willing to forgo the privilege.
Could I see the before again?
You kinda have to be there to appreciate it.
"No, I can appreciate it from here."
"Luckily you won't have to, since you're coming up there with me next week."
But I have a meeting with my editor in town next week.
"That's all right, it's only minutes away."
You take the train in for your meeting.
Then right back out when you're done.
"You've just thought of everything, haven't you?"
You're coming to the country with me.
See...I'm what you call a bona fide city girl.
I'm the kind of girl that goes to a late movie in the middle of the week.
"Could you tell your little pal, Steve, to call his insurance company?"
They can't find him and they think that I'm his in case of emergency person.
"So, he needs to update that whole file."
"I know he wants to talk to you about some stuff, too."
"No, what is he gonna tell me?"
"Now that Jessica's gone, he wants to start seeing me again?"
That he can't stop thinking about me?
That he's still in love with me?
"That I'm a horrible, selfish bitch?"
"Several blocks south, Charlotte also found herself in a compromising position."
"Whatever it is you're doing, don't stop."
My basal body temperature reading says I won't be ovulating for another five days.
That means we have five days of practice to get it right.
"You need to conserve your juices till then, so they'll be at their most powerful."
"I'm sorry, it's just... we've been trying for three months, and I don't wanna take any chances."
We're gonna be in Connecticut on Saturday.
But I was thinking maybe we could stay here and concentrate on this.
"We miss the orchid show, she'll be devastated."
Then I guess we'll just have to have sex at your mother's.
There's a first time for everything.
The doctor said it's very trendy now.
"Lance Armstrong had it, the Drew Barry more guy."
"That's right, it's no big deal."
He's just gotta get in there and snip one of those guys out of there and I'm done.
"Good, so, then it's stage one, right?"
I looked it up on the net.
"Sure, stage one, you have the operation."
"No, stage one, the cancer hasn't spread to the lymph nodes."
"Your doctor gave you an ultrasound, right?"
"I turned my head, I coughed."
Who the hell is this doctor?
Has he got a storefront outside Port Authority?
I got him through my HMO.
I talked to some guys in my office who have been through this.
"Don't worry, I used a pseudonym."
They gave me the name of a specialist at Beth Israel.
You don't have to do that.
You don't have to do anything.
"I have a doctor, it's no big deal."
This isn't your crazy yellow toenail.
"The longer you wait to find out what's going on, the longer we sit here having this conversation, the more likely it is that the cancer will spread and that you will die."
It is a big fucking deal
"No, first, I yelled at him."
"I yelled at my friend, the cancer patient."
"I mean, you just lost your mom."
"I'm sure you have a lot of pent up, residual anger."
"Maybe, but mostly he was just pissing me off."
"Sounds like he needed the good kick in the ass, which you gave him."
"A nice, relaxing weekend with me at Aidan's country house."
"You're not actually going, are you?"
"If by ''going'' you mean being taken against my will and kidnapped, then yes, I'm going."
Because this weekend I'm a hick town hostage.
"I can't go, Steve has cancer."
Somebody has to stay in town and make him feel bad about it.
It's like we're living in Paris and running off to Provence for the weekend.
What is it about the weekends now?
"I swear to God, every guy I've fucked since Memorial Day wants to know what I'm doing this weekend."
"My weekends are for meeting new guys, so I don't have to fuck the old ones."
I guess I'll have to brave the wilderness on my own.
"Not on your own, with Aidan."
"Just because Aidan loves the country, you have to love it, too?"
You need to pretend to be someone else to be in a relationship.
"No, I believe the word you're looking for is ''compromise.''"
"Trey loves golf, so, I'm taking golf lessons."
"Trey loves Bunny, so, I'm ovulating at the orchid show."
Which hick town is it exactly?
It's too terrible and too ironic.
Sounds like you better take some Buffern to Suffern.
There's a lake right over there.
"The plumbing's so, of course, it needs work."
But I put in a hot water heater all by myself.
Scary as you thought it'd be?
Let me stick this stuff in the back.
And I'll give you the grand tour.
"So, there I was... trapped in a cabin that was outdated even by CiviI War standards when I could've been out cocktailing and sample saleing."
"There was a huge, giant squirrel in that window, right there."
I've been sneaking little nuts out there.
"Hoping he'd come make friends, and he did."
You can't be friends with a squirrel.
A squirrel is just a rat with a cuter outfit.
Any more Wild Kingdom surprises I should know about?
"Hours later, we discovered one satisfying way to pass the time in the country."
"There I was, miles from home, hours from sleep with no one to talk to, nowhere to go, and nothing to do except.... Three hours, two mosquitoes, and one too many Vodka KooIAids later."
"I finally found an outlet for my computer, but not my frustration."
"Relationships, no matter how good, are inevitably a series of compromises."
But how much of ourselves should we be willing to sacrifice for the other person before we stop being ourselves?
"In a relationship, when does the art of compromise become compromising?"
"Meanwhile, back at the center of the civilized world..."
"So, what are you doing next weekend?"
"Tired of being the ''wake up and smell the coffee'' girl, Miranda invited Steve over for tea and sympathy."
"Or in Steve's case, Chinese food and Chop Socky."
I thought you hated these movies.
"And the guy at Video Village said this one rocks, so... You want the last spring roll?"
"That's it, I'm out of here."
"You think I wanna stay here, and be treated like some fuckin' cancer patient?"
Since when don't you want the last spring roll?
You usually eat all these spring roll.
I'm lucky if I see a spring roll.
"In the park, you needed a shoulder to cry on."
And I was a total bitch to you.
"You know what, thank God, because now I have a doctor who knows what he's doing."
"I scheduled my operation, and I have insurance that's gonna pay for it."
"So, thank you for being a huge bitch."
"The next day at the MacDougal's Connecticut compound, Bunny gave Charlotte a tour of her nursery."
"Since my boys have all grown up, my orchids have become my babies."
"And this year, Waxie Hanahan's Chocolate Oncidium will be no match for my Rising Suns."
"I'm pleased you think so, Charlotte."
I've repotted this one for you to take home.
A gift in anticipation of the great gift you're giving me.
You mustn't be cross with Trey for telling me.
He knows how anxious I am to have a wee MacDougal to carry on the family name.
I couldn't get any sleep at all last night.
The silence out here is deafening.
Then I go to take a shower and there's no water.
"So, now, he's working on the pipes all day, so I finally had to leave the house before I dehydrated."
"Yes, I'd like a cheeseburger, please, large fries, and a Cosmopolitan?"
I'm at the Frozen Cup in HoHoKus.
"I had to freaking drive to New Jersey to get cell service, and apparently, the only way to get anything to eat in the country is to make it yourself."
I'm in no mood for Bisquick.
Bunny's already picking out names and schools for her grandchild.
She wouldn't even let the cook put shrimp in my omelet this morning.
How far is my country from your country?
He's got squirrels running in here and there.
"Four legs good, two legs bad."
"You didn't say that to him, did you?"
I don't even know what I'm doing out here.
"I'm trying, but he's out there hoeing."
"So, what are we gonna be doing?"
Are we gonna be schlepping these railroad ties over to the mudhole?
"Ok, I'm not being helpful anymore."
I think I should get back to the city.
I have that meeting to get ready for.
"Four hours later, I kissed Aidan goodbye, kicked the mud off my boots, and had a New York steak with my New York ex."
"I tried, I really did, but nature and me... it's unnatural."
And I love being with Aidan.
"I mean, there's no one in the world that I would rather be..."
Is it ok to talk to you about this stuff?
I'm glad that we can talk about this stuff.
"And listen, if you ever meet someone, I want you to feel"
"If I tell you, you can't tell anyone."
"She's not an actress, she's a movie star."
Did you see that Spy GirI movie?
I thought she was pretty good.
I do know she wears many wrong things on the red carpet.
I cannot believe you are dating... someone named after a tree.
"She came up to me at her premiere thing and asked for a light and said, ''I have two vices, smoking and green eyed men.''"
"We talked, had a few... went up to her hotel... dress comes off... red panties."
"I lifted her up, I put her on the bed"
I think I did pretty good.
How's the stock market treating you these days?
"The thing of it is, I can't get her out of my head."
Willow Summers is crazy about me.
When I walked home from her hotel
"Yeah, the red panty, green eyed connection."
"As I walked off my Big dinner, I realized I'd gone from pretending I didn't hate being in the country to pretending I didn't hate listening to Big's Willow talk."
"I may have been back in the city, but now I was really suffering."
I had to get back to the country.
"But this time, I wouldn't rely on the country to provide the entertainment."
I would take the entertainment with me.
You've got to be kidding me.
It's hotter here than it is outside.
Can't we turn on the air conditioning or something?
You have to entertain me when Aidan goes to bed in an hour.
You lured me here under false pretenses.
I told you that it was rustic.
Aidan worked very hard on this place.
Did you know that he put that hot water heater in all by himself?
"Actually, I was wearing gloves at the time, but thanks for the shout out."
Is it hot in here or is it just me?
It couldn't be any hotter in here.
Who's the farmer with the delts?
Came out here from the city after the last big market crash.
"He doesn't say much, kinda keeps to himself."
"So, what does he do out here?"
"Pushups, by the look of him."
"What are you up to, SammyJo?"
"Honey, if we're gonna bake us a pie, we're gonna need us some milk."
"I'm staying next door, and I'm baking a pie from scratch."
And I suddenly realized... fresh out of milk.
But only until I can afford a little farm all my own.
But something tells me I'd be very good at it.
Squeeze off the milk with your thumb and forefinger.
Then roll down into a fist.
I think I can do that.
I usually get a little warning before that happens.
I guess it just takes practice.
Anything else around here need milking?
While Samantha worked up an appetite
"So, get out of the tub, get into this bed, and make love to me right now"
"Charlotte, I was just telling Trey how much you remind me of myself at your age."
What are you doing in here?
What were you doing up there?
Your mother was watching you bathe.
We were having a conversation while I was in the bath.
I don't know how you were brought up.
But that is not acceptable parent child bath time behavior past the age of
"lf you think that I'm bringing a child into that, that I will be that kind of mother, then you better think again."
"She may have raised you like that, but I am not your mother."
I was raised by a woman named Eva Neal.
"I don't remember ever seeing my mother ever, except after her tennis lesson and before the cocktail hour when she would draw me a bath and tell me how she'd spent her day."
"So, I know, I have always known that you could never ever be that kind of mother."
"Ok, but I have to get in the right position."
I have to get my legs up.
"While trying to make a baby, Charlotte and Trey accidentally destroyed Bunny's, and Waxie Hanahan's Chocolate Oncidium won first prize for the second year in a row."
"Back in New York, the patient Steve was greeted by a patient Miranda."
He said everything looked pretty good down there.
"I told him, frankly, I'd seen better."
You're going to have to leave now.
"No, I'm sorry, I don't think so."
I'm his in case of emergency person.
"It s ok, Miranda, if you wanna go."
Shut up or I'll give you a sponge bath.
"Meanwhile, on his farm, Young McDonald had Samantha."
"You're a man of few words, but they're all the right ones."
What are you doing next weekend?
Now all we have to do is put apples in and it s pie.
The only thing that I have ever successfully made in the kitchen is a mess.
"Come on, you feel like peeling some apples?"
I feel like taking a shower.
"You've been outside all day, and I've been cooped up in here."
"House, just say it, you hate the house."
I don't know where anything goes and I burned my legs.
Maybe from now on I should just come on the weekends.
I don't have to come at all.
One slow train ride and two fast food apple pies later...
"Why would anybody go to the trouble of making one when you can buy one that's so perfect, and individually sized?"
"Wait a minute, hold still, sweetie."
"Please, I am never leaving this city again."
"Actually, the country's looking pretty good to me right about now."
"Really, so you'll be back next weekend?"
"So, when are you going back?"
"In the end, of course, Aidan and I compromised."
He spent money on air conditioning.
And I spent enough time in Suffern to realize that city girls are just country girls... with cuter outfits.
There are a million reasons to celebrate in New York City: Steve no longer having testicular cancer was just one of them.
I only have one ball left.
It's me and you after this.
It all comes down to just one little ball.
There s nothing to be embarrassed about.
"Miranda, they come in a set like earrings."
"If it were me, I'd be sitting at home depressed."
Tell me why you d be depressed if you were perfectly healthy but had to go through life without balls?
"Maybe it's bullshit, but I might feel less of a man or something."
A couple of hanging glands has nothing to do with making somebody a man.
I once went out with a guy with the biggest balls I've seen.
I could barely fit one in my mouth.
The irony is I don t think women care that much about balls.
I have never met a man who wasn't into his balls.
I went out with this guy...
"Now, I'm thinking balls are to men what purses are to women."
It s just a little bag but we'd feel naked in public without it.
Just designed the new Richard hotel.
I've been trying to get a meeting with him for months.
I think he's talking to Brad Rosen.
"And up on Park Avenue, a different reason for celebrating."
"So, I told him, when I hire a contractor to do a job, I expect him to finish on time."
Sometimes they just need to hear it from a man.
"A little more Mu Shu, my Mu Shu."
I saw my doctor today and I told her how frustrated we were that we weren't pregnant yet.
She said that the easiest thing to do would be to test your sperm.
Is it too much to ask to have my Mu Shu without a side of sperm?
Why are you getting so mad?
"Hell's bells, it's only been three months"
Why would you just leap to the conclusion that the problem is me?
It s just easier to test the man first.
I'm sure your sperm is fine.
"No, it's better than fine, it's fantastic."
This little subject matter has put me right off my dinner.
Why don't we give a little tug and see?
You wanna give a little tug?
You're gonna do it too hard
You were saved by the bell.
"Bradshaw House of Pain, how can we hurt you?"
I'm sorry to be calling you this late.
I need to talk to you.
"It s really not a good time, we're about to go to bed."
"Willow is totally fucking with my head, please."
I'm gonna be just a minute.
"Apparently, dating a movie star makes you as crazy as dating anyone else."
"She's in town, at the Mercer."
We were supposed to meet tonight.
She hasn't gotten back to me.
I called all five of her numbers.
"Here's the thing, see she can reach me, but I can't ever get her."
"She can reach me but I can't get her, ever."
I thought everything was going great.
"It was, I mean, I flew out to LA to take her to that MTV award thing."
I'd better start feeling sorry for you soon.
And then she totally dissed me.
I was following her around like a goddamn dog.
I'm just gonna be one more minute.
Listen to this message she left me.
"I can't wait until I'm in New York, in your arms."
I'm in a New York state of mind.
'A New York state of mind''?
"It s Billy Joel, we love that song."
"So, you still want me to give them a little pull?"
Why'd you take the phone in there?
"Because I know you don't like him calling here, that's all."
"You tell me nothing's going on, then nothing's going on."
You don't gotta run in a closet.
I didn't run and I went in there because I know how uncomfortable it makes you.
"How uncomfortable it makes me, or you?"
I don't want you to feel threatened.
You think I'm threatened by him?
Who said anything about taking him?
It s like the time Batman and the Green Hornet got in a fight.
"Everyone expected Batman to win because he's got the gadgets and the cape, the shit, but the Green Hornet had the moves."
"See, I'm the Green Hornet, I got the moves."
"Plus, I got Pete and he's like Kato."
"Petey, come here, boy, come here"
What do superheroes have to do with it?
"All I know is that in order to deal with Big, he had to turn himself into the Green Lantern."
I don't care if he's the Green Bee.
I just wish there was a way for Aidan to really understand that he has nothing to worry about.
Maybe I should try to get Big and him and me together.
Did you have a big plate of crazy for lunch?
"We could all talk and Aidan could see once and for all that I love him, and Big and I are just friends."
Keeping my relationship with Big in the closet only makes things worse.
"They can't help it, it's all that crazy testosterone."
Is it not doing well in school?
We were discussing it over dinner last night and he just blew up.
"One minute he was perfectly happy, the next minute, furious."
It s a side of Trey I've never seen.
What is it with that area?
I spent the afternoon thinking about my friends.
"Body image depression, unpredictable mood swings, late night phone calls obsessing about a relationship."
Did I mention these are my male friends?
"So, maybe men and women aren't from different planets as pop culture would have us believe."
"Maybe we live a lot closer to each other, perhaps, dare I even say it in the same zip code?"
"In view of current circumstances, I couldn't help but wonder, are men just women with Balls?"
Did you know you can't enter a dog in a dog show if he's only got one Ball?
They even make fake dog Balls.
"They make them for humans, too."
Women get breast implants all the time.
"Steve, trust me, I've been to the area and I swear to God, I wouldn't know if you had one or four."
"Every time I look down at my nuts, correction, nut, I look all lopsided."
"We care about nice arms, great eyes, big dick."
"I have never once heard a woman say, ''He had such a big, full scrotum ''"
"Samantha finally got her meeting with hotel magnate, Richard."
"Smart, tough, a real ball buster."
"I've enjoyed meeting you, but truth be told, Ms. Jones, your r??sum?? s all fluff."
It s just parties and social events.
What is it that you do in your hotels?
"If I wasn't, you would've been down in the lobby having a cappuccino minutes ago."
Maybe you two can get together and share the work.
"Five hotels, it's a big job."
I know it's a big job.
That's why I'm still here and not down in the lobby having a cappuccino.
"I appreciate your offer, but I don't need a partner."
"Read between the lines, Ms. Jones."
I deal with a lot of business men.
That businessmen would be more comfortable dealing with a woman if she were working next to a man?
You have a lot to offer.
You might want to consider working with a partner who isn't so emotional.
"'Emotional'' is just code for, ''I don't want to hire a woman.''"
"They're that way at my firm, too."
Think you're gonna cry over a legal brief.
Have you ever cried over a brief?
"Certainly, but only in the privacy of my office."
"I cried once at the gallery, once, in years, and from that day on it was, ''Careful, don't make Charlotte cry.''"
I have never cried at work.
I fake cried to my editor when I missed a deadline.
"I told him I was having a bad time at home, but really I was having a good time in the Hamptons."
That makes the rest of us look bad.
"Boo hoo, it was degrees and sunny."
"A guy gets angry in a meeting, he's a pistol, a woman, she's emotional."
"If I say anything, like, ''I don't think that's hung high enough'' they say, ''Careful, don't make Charlotte cry''"
What does he think I'm going to do?
Get my period and ruin his empire?
"Yes, men, wait let me rephrase that, some men"
That will look much better on the court transcripts of this dinner.
Some men are threatened by strong businesswomen.
They have to find a way to make her be just a woman again.
"I'm going back in there, guns blazing, cool, calm, collected."
I'm going to impress that arrogant motherfucker so much he's gonna beg me to take the job.
I've gotta run or I'm gonna miss my ride with Aidan.
"Then I'll have to take mass transit to the country, then there'll be some tears."
"The next day, while Aidan was tearing down the old shed, I was tearing through the new in Style with Big's big movie star on the cover."
Hope you don't mind my calling.
I got the number off your machine.
She said she never wants to see me again.
I don't even know what I did.
"See, she can reach me, but I can't get her."
She has the eyes of a crazy person.
"Man, I was such a chump."
I really put myself out there and she drop kicked me right in the fucking heart.
When are you coming back to the city?
"I'd invite you out here, but it's just so far away."
"It s minutes, you know, if there's no traffic, but with the weekenders and everything, I don't know, an hour, maybe even two."
"Yeah, don't you have to work?"
I'll get my Jag out of the garage.
Maybe the drive will do me good.
"I'll come up for an hour, we ll talk, and then I'll head home."
We gotta close these windows up.
Did I hear the phone ring?
"That crazy movie star lady broke up with him, he's devastated."
He has no one else to talk to.
Before I knew it I was telling him to make a right at the sign for Farm Fresh Summer Squash.
I don't want him in my house.
"He's gonna come up here, we're gonna have a quick talk."
Then he's gonna go right back to the city where he belongs.
He's just a friend in pain.
"I would never do this, but he's really hurting."
"Come on, haven't you ever had a girl break your"
He better be fucking upset when he gets here.
He's got some balls coming up here.
"The prosthesis approximates the weight, shape, and feel of a normal testicle."
"Now, it comes in four sizes."
"Extra small, small, medium, and large."
"I'd be a Jeez, Miranda, what would I be?"
"Now, to get this model you have to enroll in a Clinical trial for market clearance."
It s still being tested for safety.
"I assure you, it's perfectly safe."
That's what they said about the Ford Pinto.
You want a Pinto near your penis?
"And in a different urologist's office, at the exact same time."
The nurse said you wanted to see me.
I'm afraid our old problem has reared its ugly head.
I can't seem to rise to the occasion.
Let's not assume it's the same problem.
I know how much you like them.
You knew I'd have a problem.
It s the Big Boob Bonanza issue
I don't think I can handle another problem in that area.
"Don't you worry, Trey MacDougal, I'm sure that you have very strong Scottish sperm."
"And if you don't, we can just spin them and whip them up and do whatever it is you sexy doctor types do."
"You know, you give a little tug."
"Turned out, Trey's Scottish sperm was fine."
"I have to admit, you're the best person for the job."
But I'm not gonna hire you.
Give me one legitimate reason why not.
Do I have to say it?
I'd like to hear the words come out of your mouth.
"Ok, you slept with my architect."
"Turns out, Samantha was wrong, men do talk."
And I don't wanna get into all that.
And how does my personal life affect your business?
I think the more accurate question would be how does your personal life affect your business?
"Other than that, you had the job."
"If I was a guy, you would have shaken my hand, bought me a scotch and given me a key to an office."
A man with such innovative vision can be so shortsighted.
She could feel the tears building up inside her.
"The next day, Richard hired Samantha."
He told her he admired her balls.
"When Big still hadn't arrived two hours later, I was secretly praying he'd missed the sign for Farm Fresh Summer Squash."
"Then, there it was, the Bat mobile."
Maybe he doesn't wanna come in and meet your dad.
What're you doing just sitting here?
I don't want to go in.
Let's go have a drink or something.
At a Ye Old Country lemonade stand?
Why are you listening to that?
"Come on, turn off the car and come inside."
I can't talk about this in front of him.
"Yes, you can, and you better."
"An hour and two bottles of red wine later, Big started talking."
"Unfortunately, it was mostly to himself."
'Her luminous skin ''a product of vegan diet discipline.''
"All right, give me the magazine."
"No, wait, listen to this one."
''I'm looking for that someone special.''
''Let's go have a drink and a smoke sometime.''
You can't smoke in the house.
"Look at him, he can't drive."
What do you think you're doing?
We're an hour outside New York.
"I'm in a New York state of mind, seen all the movie stars."
You're gonna have to sleep on the couch.
"After the Ball plan backfired, Miranda took Steve out to dinner to lift his spirits."
Here's the book I was telling you about.
"Steve, I'm starting to hit my limit."
I just I was just really counting on that fake Ball.
"It s just, every time I look down there, I feel"
"This may be hard for you to understand, but who's gonna fuck a uniball bartender?"
Miranda realized the one thing she could do to help Steve didn't involve books or Balls.
You have to go out there and make friends with him.
"We're middle aged men, we don't make friends."
"If you and Aidan don't become at least a little friendly, I won't be able to stay in your life."
"You're a guy, he's a guy, there's a ball, figure it out."
I guess I got a little drunk.
I didn't mean to come up and ruin your weekend or anything.
"Here, why don't you give me a shot?"
"A little muddy, I guess all that rain."
That dog just bit my ass
"And just like that, Kato stopped the fight."
"And the thing is, see she could reach me but I could never get her."
"Day or night, whenever she could reach me, I couldn't get her."
"Somehow, the storm had passed and I never fully understood why."
"Ok, maybe men and women don't live in the same zip code, but we're moving closer."
In life sometimes we find ourselves at a crossroads.
In New York that crossroads tends to be busy and very loud.
"I'm sorry, I only have a"
You'll make some man very happy.
"No, I just thought it might be a fun thing to say."
"I took three EPT tests and I'm coming from my doctor, which is why I called you to meet me way down here on the corner of d and ''I'm in Hell.''"
When have you been having sex?
I did not mean that the way it sounds.
"I felt bad, he only had one Ball."
I guess that's all he needed.
Apparently the other one was purely ornamental.
"God, I'm such a fucking idiot."
Why didn't I use a condom?
He only has one Ball and I have a lazy ovary
In what twisted world does that create a baby?
It s like the Special Olympics of conception
Is it ok not to tell him?
"While Miranda took a pregnant pause, Charlotte got an unpleasant surprise of her own, her period."
Would you please move the Tampax away from my toast points?
"When I think of all those women, every day getting pregnant, getting pregnant."
"I've been trying for five months, nothing"
A woman of has only a percent chance of conceiving.
The numbers go down from there.
"If it's so hard, how do you account for the number of crying children on planes?"
This is not a laughing matter.
"I thought this was brunch, not a fertility seminar."
"Charlotte, should we get you a menu?"
I probably can't have a baby.
"It s me, I know it's me."
I keep hearing all these stories about people getting pregnant just looking at each other.
"I do it on my head, on my side, on my back, on the top, on the bottom, on the top, then the bottom."
Do you know how many times Trey and I have done it without a condom?
Have you any idea how much perfectly fine semen that is?
Enough for me to know in my bones that it's me.
The big joke is I spent my entire worried that I'd get pregnant.
I could've screwed everything in sight
I should've been so lucky to get pregnant by mistake.
"Ok. What's with the eyes, Miranda?"
You haven t said a word and you're making ''the eyes.''
You think I'm pathetic or something?
I cannot think of a worse time to tell you this.
What the ''f'' is going on?
"He only has one ball, it isn't fair"
"Here, honey, have a sip of water."
How could you do this to me?
You're not even going to consider having it?
This is not in my plans right now and I really feel awful talking about this in front of you.
You can just sit here and have your abortion talk.
"Come on, Charlotte, please sit down."
All she can think about right now is babies.
"Ok, it's less than a desirable situation, but it happens."
"Carrie, how many have you had?"
"Right, that waiter at TGI Friday's."
"Please, can we not make this worse than it was?"
"He was a waiter at The Saloon, ok?"
"And let me remind you, in The Saloon was very happening."
Are you going cuckoo on me?
"Ok, I want to tell you something, but if I tell you, you have to swear you're not gonna tell anyone."
"Ok, Miranda's pregnant and she's having an abortion."
"And Charlotte's devastated, because she's been trying to get pregnant."
"She's been having a really hard time, and it's just bad all around."
"If Miranda doesn't want the kid, can't she just give it to Charlotte?"
"See, this is the reason that you can't tell anyone."
I feel like you just trapped me.
"I'm sorry, I had to tell you."
It s all I could think about.
"Look, I can't even pick a shoe."
She's gonna do it without telling him.
"Technically, it does not gonna be anybody's baby."
It seems like the guy gets the shit end of the stick.
You know it's a tough situation.
"Look at that one, isn't it adorable?"
The red one in the middle.
"Honey, it's not so much the style as what carrying it means."
"When I'm tooling around town with that bag, I'll know I've made it."
"Ok, let's go, the visiting hours are over."
I'm going with Miranda when she goes.
I was alone and it was awful.
Why didn't you just ask someone to go with you?
It s not the kind of thing you list on the dorm activities board.
I lied to Aidan about having one.
"And the thing is, I think he seemed relieved, relieved that he could still think of me in a certain way."
I don't know why I lied to him.
Maybe you still want him to think of you in a certain way.
You made the right decision at the time.
"I know, but I never told the guy or anything."
"Look, you can't go down that road."
Did you really want to have a child with a guy who serves burgers on roller skates?
I could have a earold child.
But then I wouldn't have known you.
"So many roads, so many detours."
"So many choices, so many mistakes."
"As we drive along this road called life, occasionally a gal will find herself a little lost."
"When that happens, I guess she has to let go of the coulda, shoulda, woulda buckle up, and just keep going."
"As we speed along this endless road to the destination called ''Who We Hope To Be'', I can't help but whine, are we there yet?"
"For a publicist like Samantha, the road to success was paved with stars."
"Case in point, lunch with Lucy Liu."
I had no idea you were from New York.
I'm a total New York City girl from Queens.
I just don't get ''Queens'' from you.
"Look, bitch, don't start with me, 'right?"
I'm looking for someone from New York.
"guy was really hooked up, but he was a total liar."
"I'm a big girl, just tell me the truth."
"I can take it, you know?"
Your last Golden Globe dress was a disaster.
"Thank you, that's what I thought."
But the queens kept telling me it was fierce.
A girl from Queens should know better than to listen to queens.
"I was a waitress, and twenty five percent, very nice."
"When I'm representing you, it's class all the way."
Samantha was never one for waiting in line.
So she cut right to the front.
"It s not for me, it's for Lucy Liu."
I'm her press rep and I would love for her to carry this bag to a premiere next week.
It would be photographed to death.
"Let me get Francesca, our press rep, on the phone."
"And over on Park Avenue Charlotte decided she couldn t wait any longer, either."
I'm calling to make an appointment with Dr. Peck.
We're having some I'm having some difficulty.
I think I need some fertility testing.
I would like to make an appointment with Dr. Genya.
"I need to come in for a procedure, I'm pregnant."
And l need not to be.
"A couple of days later, Samantha went down a road she shouldn't."
How the fuck long does Lucy Liu have to wait for that Birkin?
"If they're so hard to get, maybe you can explain why I just saw a fucking nobody in a track suit carrying the exact one we want"
"Lucy Liu is a big big fucking star, and she wants that bag"
Is ''Herm?s'' French for ''We take our good old fucking time''?
It s not a breaking and entering.
We were playing basketball and your guy needed to take a leak.
"The bar's busting my hump, but it's pretty good."
"So, how's Miranda, is she ok?"
"I've been calling, she don't call me back."
"She must be pretty busy then, I guess."
"Listen, it's ok, I can't keep secrets either, obviously."
That's the way he looks at everyone.
But I think he deserves to know.
I don't agree with what she's doing.
It doesn't have anything to do with you.
I'd just as soon not know any of it.
"Listen, sometimes you get in situations that are hard."
You wish not be having this conversation with him in the next room.
My regular doctor doesn't do them.
That's the way she said it.
Like it was all one word.
''I don't perform them no judgment.''
"So, I'm waiting to see if this other doctor can fit me in."
I want to get it over with as soon as possible.
Have you thought any more about telling Steve?
"No, why would I tell Steve?"
"I don't know, maybe he has a right to know."
"He will not, I made him swear on Chanel."
As long as he took the oath of fabric.
He seemed to have pretty strong opinions about the guy having a right to know.
"You know, I didn't think this could get any worse, but it has."
Now I have to think about what I'm doing to Steve?
"I don't even want to know, and it's me."
Did you tell the guy from TGI Friday's?
I was we barely knew each other.
After a drunken night at The Tunnel.
I was thinking maybe I should have told him.
There's no way I'm telling Steve.
He'd want me to have it.
"Forget my life, I'm having Steve's baby."
Your blood and mucus tests show extremely elevated antisperm antibodies.
It just means it's gonna be that much more difficult for you to conceive naturally.
I'd give it a percent shot.
I would not suggest you wait much longer before you explore in vitro.
"After they learned about their detour on the road to baby, Trey had to go back to the Hospital and Charlotte decided to walk home."
"You saw me, turned, and walked the other way."
"I didn't see you, I just changed direction."
First you don't return my calls.
Then you pretend not to see me on the street?
I just I really can't see you right now.
"You have to see me, because I'm standing right here."
"I'm sorry about this whole thing, but it's not a personal attack on you."
I really don't want to talk about this.
"This is hard for me, too, you know?"
"It doesn't make it any easier, worrying that you hate me because you think you can't get pregnant."
I just came from the doctor.
My body is attacking Trey's sperm
chance of ever having a baby
Is it ok if I go now?
You want me to walk with you?
"I just want to be alone, ok?"
"But I'll walk a little way behind you, in case you change your mind and want to talk."
Charlotte walked all the way home.
"And even though she never turned back, she knew Miranda was behind her."
Some nice man dropped it off at my hotel this morning.
"It s not really my style, but it's a free bag"
"There was a five year waiting list, blah, blah, blah, I used your name."
"As long as we're cutting to the chase, the P.R."
rep from Herm?s called and told me my rep yelled ''fuck'' at her at least times.
Is that your idea of class?
I have never used the ''f'' word.
Who the fuck are you kidding?
"Yes, I called to check on the bag."
Maybe she picked up some crazy person.
One time I got this scary woman screaming from somewhere in New Jersey.
The only thing worse than a liar is a bad liar.
I won't be needing your services anymore.
I am telling you the truth.
"If I was as bad an actress as you, I'd still be serving onion rings at TGI Friday's."
ALL 'cause of a lucy lie.
"Meanwhile, I found myself back at a familiar crossroads, the corner of Columbus and"
"His roller skates were gone and his Tony Danza Taxi hair was thinner, but it was definitely Chad."
Our soups of the day are lentil and tortilla.
Did anyone get your drink order?
"I came in a few times, half lemonade, half iced tea?"
And then there was that night at The Tunnel.
"Sherry, I'm sorry, I don't remember."
"I'll take the lentil soup, I guess, and some crackers."
Was I at least smart enough to try something?
I stayed in just long enough to realize I had made the right decision.
"Even though I was sitting in the same seat, I was in a totally different place."
I think I can write that in.
How long until I feel back to normal?
You're gonna have to ask them.
How long until you felt back to normal?
"I think, what do you think?"
You wanna go one more round?
"Charlotte only has a percent chance, and she's really trying."
What if I wake up at and find that my one semi decent ovary gave up and I can't have kids.
This happened against all the odds.
My stupid egg found its way to the three sperm he had left.
"I mean, what am I waiting for?"
"Sweetie, do you want to leave?"
I could barely find the time to schedule this abortion.
"I thought some flowers might do whatever it is, flowers are supposed to do in a situation like this."
I felt the same way about Entenmann's lemon strudel.
"And with those four little words, three aunts were born."
"As for me, I shoulda left Miranda's earlier so I woulda been on time."
They wouldn't seat me till my party was here.
It ll be a bit of a wait.
"Fine, I'll put your name on the list of the bar."
I'm afraid you're gonna judge me.
For being and sleeping with a guy without a condom and getting pregnant and never telling him.
Did you ever get a girl pregnant?
"Goddamn, it must be nice to be a guy sometimes."
"So, am I still your girl?"
They say life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
"But sometimes in New York, life is what happens when you're waiting for a table."
"New York welcomes and shelters the tired, the poor, the persecuted who have been forced to leave their homes at the whim of a ruling class."
"Therefore, it's ironic that all Manhattanites face the same horrible uncertainty, knowing that any day they may have to utter the tragic words."
"I have to move, this is a nightmare."
Why don't you just buy the place?
I really don't think I'm in a position to buy an apartment.
"Afraid so, and she's sexy and I like it."
You're not buying my apartment for me.
I could sell my place and buy this place and that place next door.
We could tear down that wall.
So then are you .Would that make you my landlord or my roommate?
What would the rent be like?
"I have to admit, I was tempted by his offer."
We were spending almost every night together already and we were in love and moving is such a pain in the ass.
And so were the hormone injections Charlotte was facing nightly.
"I don't approve of this, Charlotte."
You've got more hormones in you than a teenage boy.
This is what we have to do now.
We ought to try to have a baby the old fashioned way.
Why don't we sit around and wait for a stork?
The doctor said there's still a chance.
"If you had a patient who had a very slim chance of living, would that be good news?"
"Would you tell the family, ''Buck up, he's got a shot in hell''?"
That's why we have to move on to in vitro.
It took Peggy Woodruff seven years to conceive.
A woman I met in the elevator.
"A lot of couples have trouble conceiving, and they get through it."
"In our building, there are six couples who have been through in vitro."
"Put up a flyer in the lobby ''We're barren, how about you?''"
And Peggy invited us over on Friday night to hear all about their experiences.
As tempting as that sounds we have the Scottish Society Highland Fling Friday night.
"First comes spring, then comes fling."
"Ok, but when are we gonna talk to the Woodruffs?"
I don't wanna talk to the Woodruffs.
It s a very invasive procedure.
"The success rate is extremely low, and it can take years."
"I know, honey, so, just in case, I put us on the list for a Mandarin baby."
"As Charlotte's plan for parenthood progressed with or without Trey, I began to wonder if Aidan's plan was progressing without me."
"He never officially moved in, but his stuff was everywhere."
I saw the ring and I threw up.
What do you think you'll do if he asks?
Trey and I got engaged after only a month.
"We're together now, and that's what matters."
"When it's right, you just know."
"So, it might not be right."
Maybe this is all happening because my building is going co op.
Is this a real estate merger?
Am I a real estate bride?
"If there were unlimited apartments in Manhattan, we'd all be single forever."
What did the ring look like?
It was a pear shaped diamond with a gold band.
"Yeah, like ghetto gold, for fun."
But this is my engagement ring.
"P.S., I was a pregnant woman shopping for a ring with a man who's not the baby's father."
It s not exactly my dream scenario.
Will you yell at me every time I mention it?
Because we've got another seven months to go.
"I'll just say ''I'm not ready to get engaged yet, but I love you and I wanna live with you.''"
It s a ''yes'' to living together.
"That's a big deal, a first for me."
Don't I get some credit for that?
Try to be nice because down the road you might wanna marry him.
I'm gonna have to act surprised.
I wonder when it's gonna happen.
You know when He'll do it?
Now that I'm stuck with the bad ring.
He should have known that ring wasn't me.
How can I marry a guy who doesn't know which ring is me?
Is it true what Charlotte said?
Does anybody really know when it's right?
Is it right when it feels comfortable or is comfortable a sign that there aren't any fireworks?
Is hesitation a sign that it's not right or is it just a sign that you're not ready?
"In matters of love, how do you know when it's right?"
"Downtown, Samantha was meeting with Mr. Wright, Mr. Richard, that is."
The hotel magnate slash megaclient who was fast becoming the pain in her ass.
It took me minutes to get through your labyrinth of a lobby.
Bobby De Niro spends the weekend at Blakes and I get knocked off the page.
That little fucker has stayed at my place
We gave him the fucking penthouse suite
"Now, did you ask somebody what happened or did you just spend the morning accessorizing?"
I talked to the travel editor.
I pulled two of our ads.
I also got a full page feature on the Barcelona property out of it.
"Let's just talk business, shall we?"
"Come on, you can tell me, I'm human."
I love that you're not scared of me.
My best friend might be getting engaged.
She didn't ask you to be a bridesmaid?
"It's just, why does everyone have to get married and have kids?"
"I like to sleep around, whisk somebody off to Rio if the mood strikes me."
It s the perfect nine hour flight.
"Dinner on the jet, wake up in Brazil and spend the weekend in my little five star hotel."
Who needs a wife when you have a life?
"Meanwhile, Miranda had been waiting for the right place and the right way to tell Steve about the baby."
Instead she settled for right now.
I've only had one shot in the last few months and it was you.
I'm the only guy you've had sex with?
It s been a slow summer.
I guess it's good to know that my one Ball is still working.
"When we were together, I wanted to have a baby, you said you weren't ready."
"I'm still not ready, but when am I ever gonna be ready?"
"Man, I just went into so much debt opening my bar."
I'm thinking maybe I should sell it.
You don't have to do anything.
"I'll take care of the baby and support it and you can visit whenever you want, but it's not gonna be your problem."
"It s my decision, and it's just something I want to do for me."
Then why did you wanna talk to me about it?
I just thought you should know.
"Later that week, I decided to head Aidan off at the pass by taking him out to dinner and accepting his proposal."
I say yes to living together.
I think that we're ready for that step.
We still have to work out the money 'cause I don't want a free ride.
But We'll be sharing a life and an apartment.
"Yes, Aidan I would love to live with you."
That makes me really happy because there's something else I wanna ask you.
Would you Excuse me for a minute?
"I'm just gonna go to the bathroom God, what are you doing?"
I would say no to desserts.
"I know that you wanted to pay, but let me get this because your rent's about to skyrocket."
I wanna be able to speak to the baby.
Wouldn't we teach the baby to speak?
Sometimes you get a slightly older child.
"And anyhow, we ought to really try to understand her heritage."
"So, it's a Mandarin girl now, is it?"
"But the good news is, since we're both dark haired, people won't immediately know that she's not ours."
I hope you remembered to pick up your kilt at the drycleaner.
You know I really don't feel like going to the fling tonight.
"We have to go, it's a family tradition."
We are not gonna behave like your typical barren couple
We can't let this get us down
"Plus, I had a plaid dress made."
Maybe we should look at cutting back on your fertility drugs.
"What, come on, buddy, you've got nobody in there."
Is this the city's solution to the cab shortage?
"Admit it, you drive around looking for me, don't you?"
"Don't flatter yourself, you're on my turf."
"Get in, we're holding up traffic."
Are you seriously giving me a ride?
Raoul and I do this all day.
"Picking the ladies up, dropping them off."
"Then I've been very, very good."
"All right, then I take back one ''very.''"
How are things with country Bob?
"Things are very good there, too."
I don't think you want to know.
I bet I can handle it.
I think he wants to marry me.
"No, l it's just the kind of thing you know."
He's not the guy for you.
He might be the guy for me.
"You're never gonna be ready, baby."
"So, what does that tell us?"
"In any case, I'm not taking relationship advice, from you."
I just offered you a ride.
Did you tell Aidan I didn't like the ring?
Did you tell him not to propose?
Why hasn't he asked me yet?
"I just think it's weird, he has the ring."
What if he realized I'm not the one?
You're not sure he's the one.
"But he doesn't know that, unless you told him."
"What happened, did someone propose to you?"
I don't know why they call it morning sickness when it's all fucking day long.
Unless it's MOURN as in ''mourning'' the loss of your single life.
"Apparently, we've reached the stage where our lives are making us sick."
The New York Scottish Society's Annual Highland Fling.
"Any Scot who was anyone was there, including, of course, Bunny MacDougal."
I was wondering when you'd be arriving.
You missed dinner and the dancers.
"Hello, my dear, don't you look festive"
"Trey, you must join your brothers."
They're out there making complete fools of themselves.
"It s the Highland fling, dear."
It s what this event was named after.
"For something called a fling, it looks like a lot of work."
That's what I used to tell Trey about you.
They say this dance was originally danced on the shield of a clansman.
Do you know anything about clans?
I know this is the MacDougal clan's tartan.
MacDougal is one of the oldest Highland clans in existence.
"We have a very proud lineage, one I hope you and Trey will be able to perpetuate."
"Now, I know some things can't be helped, but I must tell you right now I don't enjoy Mandarin food and I don't enjoy a Mandarin child."
I don't think that's any of your business.
"The MacDougal name will be carried on by sons of your own, not daughters of the South Pacific."
Would you care for some shortbread?
"If we want a Mandarin baby, we can have a Mandarin baby."
Nobody else needs to be involved
"Then let's not involve the entire Scottish population of New York City, shall we?"
"I'm getting the hormone shots, I m taking the pills, I'm doing the research, I'm in the chat room with the other reproductively challenged women and I'm learning Mandarin."
All you have to do is jerk off into a plastic cup
"Charlotte, get a hold of yourself."
You get a hold of yourself
And try to keep your mother out of it
"Meanwhile, Samantha's professional relationship really started to take off."
I would have taken it off.
I'll buy you a new one.
"We're about to take off, we need you to buckle your seat belts."
"Yes, and I definitely need you to see my property in Brazil."
This is on the clock then?
"No, but, out of curiosity, what do you charge for this sort of thing?"
I need you to give me my shot.
"For the love of God, do we have to do that tonight?"
We have to do it every night if we want to continue the MacDougal clan.
What else do you expect from me?
I don't understand why you talked to Bunny.
Why don't you talk to me?
Because I don't know how to tell you I'm exhausted.
How much work is a marriage supposed to be?
This is just a tough phase.
This is what a relationship is.
"No, this is what our relationship is."
I didn t see anyone else getting screamed at on the dance floor.
I can't keep doing what we're doing.
"I love you, but I don't know if I'm cut out for this."
I don't think I wanna have a baby anymore.
"I work hard, and I like to play golf."
I just want to be for a while.
"So, you don't even want to try?"
"If it's the right thing, then it'll happen."
"If it's not, then it won't."
But we've been planning all along to have a family.
You and I will have to be enough.
"I mean, I think I could be happy with just the two of us."
"I'm not sure you can, though."
"Sometimes, the question is, how do you know when it's not right?"
It was nice being in the bed.
"When Pete has to go, Pete has to go."
"Ok, but why do I have to go?"
Make sure some hottie doesn't come along with a little pooch and steal him away.
This just gets better and better.
"I had a different one, then I changed my mind."
This one seemed more like you.
There's no one I could love more.
I wanna live my life with you.
"Maybe there are no right moments, right guys, right answers."
Maybe you just have to say what's in your heart.
And Miranda was getting a surprise as well.
I thought that's what you wanted.
"I don't want to marry you, Steve."
I don't want to marry you either.
And I just I don't wanna just be a guy who sees you at the playground.
That doesn't mean we have to get married.
"You're not in love with me, right?"
"You need to say that every day, because when you see me with this baby, you're gonna think we belong together, you re gonna think you're in love with me."
"I don't know, I've seen you with my dog, and mostly you just seem uncomfortable."
How are we gonna do this?
Raise a kid together and not be together?
"Miranda knew Steve wasn't right for her, but she wanted to do what was right for her baby."
"By the way, I know that's a hand me down ring."
I would never say yes to a hand me down ring.
"Fine, frankly, I can't afford a stupid ring and a baby."
"See, this is working out already."
There was one person I needed to tell that surprisingly I was the marrying kind.
I have something to tell you.
Let's have a drink and celebrate.
He switched the ring on me.
"And look, it's a really good ring."
Somebody had to help the poor guy.
"So, now you want me to get married?"
"No, but if you're gonna ruin our lives, I'd at least like to look at a nice piece of jewelry."
I was in Rio with Richard.
Someone once said that two halves make a whole.
"And when two halves move in together, it makes a whole lot of stuff."
"Pop tart, where you been and what have you been doing?"
"I got coffee and papers, but I think the more pressing question is, what have you been doing?"
"I needed a space for my work papers and stuff, you know, so is that okay?"
"Yeah, sure yes, it's just you're blocking the bathroom door."
"Yeah, but you got another one."
"Me, the one who loves her two bathroom doors."
Why do you need two doors for?
"Sometimes I'm in a hurry and it's just quicker to go, ping, out that one and it's my escape route in case."
"In case rapists come in my bedroom window I see them in the mirror and then, phew, I'm gone."
There's a whole lot of phewing going on in that bathroom.
It s just gonna be like this until we're able to take over the apartment next door then we can load the stuff in.
"And would that be happening in the next five minutes please, God?"
Closing at the end of next week.
The man brought a living thing into my apartment.
I kill everything I bring in there.
"You said yes to moving in, he moved in."
But he's taking over whole areas.
This is why I've never lived with a man.
"This, and the fact that I want them out an hour after I climax."
You let them stay a whole hour?
You'd be surprised how many are ready to go again after a quick catnap.
"And there's no walls, there's nowhere to hide."
"As soon as I walk in, he's all up with: ''Who'd you see?"
"What I know is, I need time to decompress."
But there have to be some adjustments.
"You guys, I miss walking into my apartment with no one there and it's all quiet and I can do that stuff you do when you're totally alone, things you would never want your boyfriend to see you do."
"My S.S.B., my Secret Single Behavior."
"Like, I like to make a stack of saltines."
I put grape jelly on them.
I eat them standing up in the kitchen reading fashion magazines.
"It s weird, but it just feels great."
I like to put Vaseline on my hands and put them in Borghese conditioning gloves while watching infomercials.
Before I was married I used to study my pores in a magnifying mirror for an hour each night.
But I'm afraid Trey will think it's weird.
You can't do that stuff in front of men.
Anything you do you wouldn't want a man to see?
"Hey, didn't we make a rule about those things at lunch?"
"It s my boss, I have to take it."
I'll see you in an hour.
He wants me to drop something off this afternoon.
"A little skyrockets in flight, afternoon Delight?"
I also like to gossip on the phone while secretly pumicing my calluses.
"And spare no detail, I'm a horny pregnant person."
I don't want to talk about it.
Or you would tell us all the dirty details.
"My God, we're gonna have to ice skate home."
He's got the most perfect dick I've ever seen.
"All right, so, what should I do about Aidan's stuff?"
I'm gonna have the girls over for dinner.
I'm trying to get my day planner back together.
I have much more free time since we left the baby track.
"Some apartments are cluttered with physical stuff, others, emotional stuff."
I've wanted a baby ever since I was a little girl.
We have a baby room and no baby.
Bram Pomander thinks he's snagged us orchestra seats to The Producers next week.
We still have to find a way to have a giggle.
"Come on, give me a smile."
How do you say fuck you in German?
"That wasn't fuck you , it was fuck me ."
That's a negotiation ploy I haven't tried before.
"It was perfect: long, pink, amazing."
I thought about you all weekend.
Let me see if I can give you something to think about all evening.
You're gonna get down on your knees right here?
What if my assistant sees you?
That may take some time to pick up.
Das ist einen sch?nen perfekten Schwanz.
"Better get those, while you're down there."
"If I had known you were gonna turn out to be so not a loser, I would have run home after work and changed."
Or at least put on some fresh deodorant.
I was a much younger man when we started trying to set up this blind date.
You're the one who kept canceling to go to Where were you?
"First time, Spain and Romethe, second time, Luxembourg and Athens."
"Walker Lewis, fluent in five Languages, traveled the world as a State Department interpreter."
"Seriously, Miranda, best blind date I have ever had in the continental U.S.A."
"Listen, any reason I can't see you again before I go to Brussels?"
He is so cute and funny and sexy.
And I really want to have sex with him.
Is it okay to fuck one guy when you're pregnant with another guy's baby?
If one more person asks me that today.
"I mean, I'm not in a relationship with the father of the baby or anything."
"I've rarely heard that used as a plus, but go on."
"And beyond tacky, is it safe?"
Let's assume he's a really great fuck.
Could all that poking shake the baby loose or something?
Married couples have sex all the time.
"Again, 'cause so many men are."
Could the dick dent the baby?
Where do you think dimples come from?
"Okay, I really need to have sex with him now."
"Next time he comes back in town, I'll be too big and he won't want to."
Nothing puts a man off sex like pregnancy.
"Yes, I am, dead woman fucking."
"It s your body, your life."
You do what's best for you.
You should ve aske Aidan not to talk when you walk in the front door.
"Okay, Mrs. Cohen, this is my friend, Miranda."
"Listen, you tell your boy I'm not leaving for days."
But we're closing in a week.
"I didn't think Mrs. Cohen could move any slower, but apparently she could."
"I been outside, and what's up is Old Lightning Rod next door informs me she will not be leaving for days."
I was afraid she was gonna do that.
What the fuck are we gonna fucking do now?
"You hate it, too, I'm so relieved"
I thought you'd already changed into a pod.
"I mean, I got all my boxes in the hall."
You can't get in the fucking door.
"I know, did you see me?"
We gotta get this stuff out of here.
We could make some room for it if we cleaned out your closet.
I have laid out clean towels on the floor of the bathroom.
Gently place the shoes and boxes on them.
How many pairs of shoes does one person need?
That is not the way to get out of this alive.
I figure I'm gonna need about half this space.
I figure you've gone mentally ill.
You never wear most of this stuff.
I never wear most of this stuff yet.
When and where were you planning to wear this?
"And for the record, have worn it."
"December, ' Union Square, book signing."
"Come on, I love this outfit."
That's when I realized I was holding on to a Roberto Cavalla outfit and throwing away my relationship.
"Don't show it to me, don't even show it to me"
That better not be the pair I think
"You can't buy it, it's circa"
"He's a dog, what's he supposed to do?"
All your shit lying around here?
My shit wouldn't be lying around if we weren't making room because your shit is lying around.
You got more shit lying around than I got lying around.
It s loaded with your shit.
Look at all your shit in my bathroom.
Who needs five almost empty Speed stick deodorants?
"What are you, a crazy bag man?"
And when have you ever worn musk?
"Look at this stuff, you got old razors, Rogaine."
I don't want to talk about it
It seems it's not only women who have Secret Single Behavior.
Don't be going through my stuff.
You were more than happy to go through my stuff.
"You always do that, you never want to let me in."
And I have let you in.
You're fighting with me about a stupid fucking outfit
I threw it away and I love it
You're telling me to shut up?
I'm so sick of hearing you talking all the time
Don't you ever just shut up?
You can stay here with your boxes of shit and your shoe eating dog and you can knock yourself out putting on the Rogaine and the Speed stick
This is why I need a second door
I used to think those people who sat alone at Starbucks writing on their laptops were pretentious poseurs.
They're people who have recently moved in with someone.
As I Looked around I wondered how many of them were mid fight like myself.
"The hard thing about fighting in relationships, as opposed to Madison Square Garden, no referee."
There's no one to tell you which comments are below the belt or when to go to your separate corners.
"As a result, someone usually gets hurt."
"And it seems, the closer a couple gets and the more ''stuff'' they have between them, the harder it is to figure out exactly why they are yelling."
When it comes to relationships I couldn't help but wonder what are we fighting for?
What are you... is that a surprise for me?
"Don't get all excited, it's just a little silly something."
I saw it in the window of a novelty store next to the hospital.
"See, now we can relax because we have one."
It was supposed to be funny.
I thought we'd have a chuckle.
"See, it was a novelty store."
And the clerk said that they sell
"But to Charlotte, it was definitely hitting below the belt."
If the meat is about a quarter of an inch thick
"And across town, Miranda decided it was time to put on the gloves and come out swinging."
"Before you leave for Brussels on Monday, how about getting together Friday night?"
"Pregnant or not, Miranda had needs and decided to stop fighting them."
"And surprisingly, Samantha developed some Secret Single Behavior of her own."
"Seven hours and a landside of lattes Later I vibrated home, prepared to admit how silly I'd been."
That was until he wasn't prepared to admit how silly he'd been.
"It s been three days, and nothing."
And I'll be damned if I say I'm sorry first.
Trey and I hardly ever yell.
"No, we're done, what's the main course?"
Richard is thinking of opening a hotel in Thailand.
It s perfectly okay to like a guy.
"For the last time, the only thing I like about Richard is his big, throbbing, rock hard, perfect dick."
"Trey, you're not supposed to be here."
I suppose she told you about the baby.
I never want to think about it again.
See I was trying to make Charlotte laugh and
"Wait a minute now, maybe they'll think it's funny."
"See, we were so tense about not being able to have one that I gave Charlotte a cardboard baby."
"I mean, it's not funny ''haha,'' but silly."
"See, they sell them in novelty stores and other people buy them, and the clerk said that it was funny."
Maybe you have to see it.
Don't you bring that thing in here
How would you feel if I gave you a cardboard cut out of a big flaccid penis?
"It s not so funny now, is it?"
"Don't you bring that flat baby in here, I will kill you"
How dare you talk to me like that in front of them?
They know about your penis problems
"There we were, right in the middle of a Wasp nest."
"No, what's unforgivable is you denying me my baby because of your own selfish, spoiled needs."
"Ever since we moved back in here, it's been nothing but ''baby, baby''"
"No, it's not too late to call."
Don't you talk to my friends like that
"Without a baby, they're all I have"
You are the man who gave me a cardboard baby
"Okay, what's so important that it couldn't wait until"
I want no part of that.
That turns everything into a big screaming mess.
Now kindly take off those pants and show me your dick.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
Seeing a bantam weight championship fight like Charlotte and Trey's made me thankful that Aidan and I were still in the banter weight division.
"That night, I slept in my clothes."
Trey and his baby slept in the guest room and Charlotte no longer cared what Trey thought.
Fuck me like there's no tomorrow.
"For her last meal, the condemned woman had seconds and thirds."
Samantha met the dawn after a night of S.S.B.
Samantha finally threw in the towel.
"All this time, she'd been trying to make him just a perfect dick, fighting her feelings that he might be the perfect Richard."
And back at the Bradshaw Shaw residence it was pretty much business as usual.
"Buddy, I need you to do something."
"I've never lived with anybody before you, so I don't know how to say this correctly but I need you to not talk to me for one whole hour."
I know that sounds pretty selfish but it's just what I need.
"We don't have any other rooms yet, so I'm gonna close these and then it's like I'm not here."
"For one whole hour, I'm not here."
"So, what are you doing out here?"
"That's the thing about needs, sometimes when you get them met, you don't need them anymore."
"As our days wore on, Aidan and I miraculously managed to not kill each other."
"But, as I predicted, the plant was not so lucky."
One of the best things about New York is that on any given night there are a million things to do.
One of the worst things about New York is trying to pick one.
"Those floors next door, they were in worse shape than yours."
You want me to see if I can get us into Town?
"You know that restaurant in the Chambers hotel, with the period in the name, Town period."
It s supposed to be amazing.
You know what sounds amazing to me?
"Nice hot shower, watching the game."
"K period, F period, C period."
Get over here and do me
Is that your standard greeting now?
"Sorry, I thought it was Richard."
That asshole said he'd call in five minutes.
I've been waiting by the phone.
My dinner might be arriving in a bucket.
You know how to do that?
How else do you have three way phone sex?
It s the first time we talked today.
Why are you guys calling me so late?
These are my last months of freedom.
Don't spend them alone in bed.
"I'm a lost cause, go on without me, save yourselves"
We have to shake things up before we officially become boring.
Not where I'd feel worse when no one's interested because I'm fat.
"Yeah, that ll have men lining up at the door."
I know exactly where we should go.
That night we finally answered the age old question: ''Where are all the hot guys?''
"They were at the hot gay club, Trade."
I feel like we don't belong here.
"Seriously, why don't straight men have bodies like this?"
Because gay men have the possibility of sex at the gym.
"If straight men had that they'd be working out all the time, too."
I've had sex at the gym.
Samantha is doing her part to motivate the masses.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
"Me, too, I bet there's no line."
We'll meet you at the bar?
"Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?"
"Sister, Day Glo Underwear, look into it."
He's a design editor for House and Garden.
I used to wear my mother's pearls and flip through it when I was little.
"I've got a great before apartment, if you're looking for an after."
"It s Park Avenue, it's so frieaking gorgeous."
We're doing an urban issue this spring.
Maybe I should check it out.
If my apartment could be in H and G magazine I would be in heaven
So how long have you worked there?
"Swell, I get him all wound up, she cashes in."
"No, but I'm hoping we will be around"
"There's no ladies' room, because Yeah, Excuse me."
Kinda like being a diabetic at Baskin Robbins.
I'm trying to order a dirty martini.
"Kurt, a dirty martini for the lovely and talented Carrie Bradshaw."
"I've only been in the States six months, and regard your column as my New York survival guide."
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
It would be cruel to kid me.
"So, then you get a discount?"
"You can't go off the market, you're my dating guru."
I'm still allowed to see other gays.
You must allow me to take you to brunch.
Can you hold this for a moment?
"Of course, I was at a film release party earlier."
I was told it's a Merchant Ivory film.
"Would I be able to enjoy this if I missed Jox and Cocks One, Two and Three?"
"Yes, but you'd want to see those eventually."
"Max was a junior associate at Miranda's law firm and, apparently, gay."
I had no idea you were a gay man either
"And there's no ladies' room, because yeah."
"Listen, Miranda, I'd kind of prefer if we didn't make an issue out of this at work."
"I just wouldn't want the older partners to start treating me differently, so"
"And between you and me, I'm pregnant."
Perhaps you should spend less time in gay clubs.
"Anyhow, I haven't told anybody at work, because goodbye to all the good cases and then it's only a matter of time before the buzzards start vying for my office."
It is a very nice office.
I peed in a men's room and outed a coworker.
I got a phone number and some porn.
I saw two dicks and took a hit of ''X.''
To think that I almost slept through this.
I can't believe you took ecstasy from a stranger.
He's a friend of my friend Bobby's friend Bobby.
Will we be going to a rave later?
"No, but I might have to drop in on Richard."
Sex on ''X'' is supposed to be amazing.
It releases all of your inhibitions.
What they fail to mention is that opposites also tend to have opposite views on what constitutes a rockin' Saturday night.
"C'mon, I had to fight a foreigner for it."
Just tuck in here and let's go to sleep.
"Hey you, I had five Cocktails."
I danced with a lot of fine half naked men.
If you would wake up right now I can almost guarantee you'd be in for some FUN.
"I ate too much chicken, I think."
"Will you rub my belly, baby?"
"I know it was wrong to compare but I felt like I had spent the evening in a Calvin Klein ad and now I was back to baseball, buckets, and BVDs."
"Meanwhile, Samantha was having excellent sex."
I am in love with you.
You told him you loved him?
All I wanted to do was to have sex
"Okay, and then what did he say?"
"Nothing, he just went to sleep."
Is it possible he didn't hear you?
Can I get a fucking cab?
"If he was any kind of gentleman at all, he'd pretend it never happened."
"But you did have sex, right?"
He fell asleep and I watched gay porn.
"See, that's what happens when people say, ''I love you ''"
"I was in love with the Taxi driver, the doorman, his sweater."
But you only said it to Richard.
I am never taking ''X'' again.
"It is a dangerous, dangerous drug."
That afternoon I was high on another feel good drug: the new gay friend.
They say you can't meet men in bars.
That was true for me last night.
I went to Trade hoping to meet someone for just a shag because I've a boyfriend in Sydney.
And the only person I met was you.
And your boyfriend doesn't mind if you date other men?
"Blow jobs only, no last names."
The gym is a free space and never ever show up at the same place wearing the same shirt.
I just crossed over into a whole other set of rules.
You've certainly worked out more options than ''Till death do us part.''
"That's all we've come up with, and frankly, I find it a little limiting."
I know gay couples who are monogamous.
I don't expect to get everything from one man.
But I guess I shouldn't be saying this to someone wearing a ring.
What's with you and this ring?
What's with you and the ring?
He's very tall and incredibly kind.
"So, why would you leave that at home on a Saturday night?"
He wanted to stay in and listen to sports with a bucket of chicken.
He would have made my dad so proud.
Have you been to Bungalow Eight yet?
"But I hear it's a pretentious, members only, tiny, crowded club that you need a key to get into."
If it isn't little Carrie Bradshaw.
"I don't mean to be rude, but I must go to the men's room."
"I've just been, you'll love it."
I saw the way you were behaving.
You're sleeping with the beautiful man.
He's only been in New York for about six months.
I picked him up at Trade.
You went to shirtless heaven without me?
I was prepared to lose you to Aidan.
Have your beautiful brunch with your beautiful man and then go home to your other beautiful man.
"Later, I started to think about restlessness and relationships."
"Once we found what we've been searching for, why are some of us reluctant to let go of our single selves?"
Is single life in New York such a constant flurry of fun and friends that settling down immediately fills us with the urge to shake things up again?
And why does becoming part of a couple imply settling down?
Maybe Oliver does have the key.
"We shouldn't expect to get everything from one man but instead, feel comfortable getting different things from different people."
"Although, at what point do separate interests become separate bedrooms?"
"I couldn't help but wonder, to be in a couple do you have to put your single self on a shelf?"
"Meanwhile, Miranda's workaholic single self was a thing of the past."
"Now, she was sleeping for two."
"Stern, Hawkins, Erickson is moving into the future."
"The entire partnership finally okayed it, finally."
"I've been working on this for what, two years now?"
Did you tell Celeste I was pregnant?
"Okay, yes, but only in your defense."
"This morning she was telling everyone how she saw you sleeping on your desk a couple of times, that you might be an alcoholic, bipolar, or something."
You told her I was pregnant?
"No, not at a law firm, no."
"Sorry, I told her it was a secret."
She's probably told everybody in the office by now.
How would you like it if I told everybody in the office that you were gay?
Maybe next you can call my grandparents.
You said we were watching an independent film.
"Relax, I've watched it already, and I'm telling you, this is really funny."
"See, that's the way to do it."
"No ''I love you,'' just good old fashioned fucking."
I am not in the mood for gay porn.
Not in the mood for gay porn?
Don't you want to know how it ends?
House and Garden wants to shoot my apartment.
I told Trey and he doesn't care.
We turned off porn to talk about a magazine?
He never cares about what I want.
Anthony is more excited about it than Trey is.
That's because gay men understand what's important.
Oliver's taking me to Bungalow Eight tomorrow night.
Sounds like you're cheating on Aidan with a gay man.
Gay boyfriends are the loophole of monogamy.
"My gay boyfriend outed me at work, then I outed him."
Even my gay relationships are dysfunctional.
"Aidan loves to stay in, and I love to go out."
"It s either the greatest relationship ever, or we're headed"
Trey's content with what we have.
"Therefore, I am a bad person for needing to have a baby."
"The next morning, Samantha and Richard were taking care of business, but not each other."
I'm not doing any more charity crap if we can't get publicity.
Steve Martin was there and he's the toast of New York.
He's the toast of The New Yorker.
Are we gonna talk about this?
That thing I said the other night.
"Samantha, you were high on ''X.''"
"Once Richard made it clear that her ''I love you'' didn't matter, Samantha realized she was secretly wishing it did."
"So, you'll yell at The Times?"
She wanted to tell him it wasn't just the drug talking that night.
But she put her real feelings on the shelf.
Fuck you at my place around
Charlotte and Trey's separate interests had become more than separate bedrooms.
They're for the photo shoot tomorrow.
Would you please move your stuff out of the guest room?
Are they photographing the guest room?
But it doesn't look very good with us sleeping in separate bedrooms.
"They want us to dress nicely, but not too formal."
They want to photograph both of us.
Because they think we're the perfect couple.
"But I promised, and they're coming."
I don't want to do this.
"It's just one picture, and it's important to me."
I don't want to do this anymore.
You are so angry at me.
"I thought that's what you wanted, too."
I don't think I should have to give that up.
I'll move back in with mother.
Charlotte and Trey's separate interests had become more than separate bedrooms.
"Meanwhile, I tried to find a way for my single self and my couple self to co exist."
"Meanwhile, I tried to find a way for my single self and my couple self to co exist."
Where are you going all dressed up like that?
I told you yesterday I was going out.
You didn't say you were going all out.
I have to see Bungalow Eight.
"No, it's a very hot club."
It s important that I know about these things.
Some people consider my column the New York survival guide.
It s just something I'm trying.
It s closer to my heart this way.
"Who are you going out with, the girls?"
"Listen, I am done for the night."
"So, you want me to jump in the shower, come with?"
I don't know if he can get us both in.
You need a key or something.
"See, that kind of attitude is not appreciated at Bungalow Eight."
Why do you even buy into that shit?
"Let's just go out to dinner, I haven't seen you all week."
"Don't forget your key, because we're very exclusive here, and we might not let you back in."
I basically discouraged him from coming.
Call and have him join us.
This is so not his scene.
Then you have to break it off.
"Right, what's a relationship compared to a night with trendy strangers?"
Turns out there's one problem with having a handsome gay man as your date.
I just love those new Prada open toed sandals.
I think I can get you a pair of those.
Is there anything to eat at Bungalow Eight?
Or is food so very last year?
"Okay, it seems you're in the middle of a spa session, so"
"You know, I left a gorgeous man at home to come here and be your date."
And I'm guessing size did as well.
"So, I'm just not really sure why I'm here."
"Because you're fantastic, and I'm sorry I was neglecting you."
If it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Down Under.
I was so preoccupied with my gay boyfriend I kept forgetting about my gay husband.
"Apparently, it was more than just brunch."
"Don't fall for him, he's just another pretty face."
He doesn't love you like I do.
I knew this woman when she took the subway and wore candies.
"I assure you, I never wore candies."
"You wore pink suede candies, and I adored you anyway."
And how dare you try to steal her away with your dreamy eyes and your probably fake accent?
I'm sorry; I didn't realize the lady was spoken for.
"And then I realized, my single self life had a shelf life, and it had just expired."
Let me buy you another drink.
"No, it's fine, I just want to go home."
"And the surprising thing was, I did."
Why do you own Jox and Cocks Four?
More research for the survival guide?
A big Thank you to our gay friends.
The most exclusive clubs only have a couple members and they're very hard to find.
"The next morning, House and Garden came to Charlotte's house."
"It s fork, fork, knife, spoon."
It's very Upper East Side breakfast for two.
"Anthony, can I talk to you a minute?"
Anyway I don't think he's gonna be in the picture.
"H and G, House and Garden?"
"Won't that look bad, just me?"
He may be the heart surgeon.
But you're the heart of this whole operation.
"Honestly, you're the best catch ever."
Look what you did to this place.
"You could take any guy off the street, fix him up and make him into something wonderful."
But you deserve more than that stick up his ass preppy.
Now get in here and have breakfast.
"All right, we ready for the picture?"
I at least want to do this.
Trey had moved out by the time the magazine was on the stands.
"But all over America, little girls in their mothers' pearls saw the picture and thought, That's what I want."
Sometimes they look prettier from the outside.
And what's inside can be different than it seems.
"When a marriage breaks up, there are numerous ways to cope."
"It s left right, not right left."
"Or, as Charlotte did, dive into a new routine."
I even signed up for sculpture and tap dancing class.
Because you can't do one without the other.
And everyone keeps telling me to take time to grieve.
"This divorce is going to be clean and swift, like pulling off a Band Aid."
"My God, I thought that was you."
"There it was, the unmistakable voice of Susan Sharon."
You're forgetting the most important thing.
"It s here, it's right here."
Why is it around your neck?
Is that what the people are doing these days?
It s closer to my heart this way.
"God, we haven't even begun to think about that stuff."
"Because these places book up, I'm telling you, years and years."
"The next morning, a hotel mogul and his publicist began another grueling day at work."
Tell me something I don't know.
"As intimate as their personal affair had become, when it came to their business affairs, Samantha remained cool and professional, in theory."
I have your column in my hand and I'm very disappointed.
"Jonesy, I thought you'd be sucking my dick for getting Richard's name in the paper."
We'll talk about your dick in a second.
I know he's canoodling with one woman and it's not Bebe London.
"Okay, guess which hotheaded publicist can't seem to keep track of her own client?"
Guess which two bit gossip columnist is talking out of his ass?
"Believe me, I'd rather be talking out of your ass."
"So, just say the word Jonesy?"
J.J. Mitchell's column said you were canoodling with Bebe London.
"He's an idiot, just giving you a heads up."
"All press is good press, right?"
"So, you were canoodling with Bebe London?"
I just need to get all the facts so I can do my job.
Why don't you take a break from your job and get that sexy ass in here?
"In an effort to drown out thoughts of Richard canoodling with Bebe London, Samantha focused on her own caboodle."
And in a more modest shower uptown
The Sheetrock guy is coming in minutes.
It s really coming along over there.
"Walls are coming down, washer dryer's on the way."
I forgot about the washer and dryer.
I've been dreaming of that my whole New York life.
Here's something else for you to chew on.
"We grab a couple friends, down some mai tais, tie the knot."
"You know, we can get ''Maui'd.''"
"Buddy, did you just pun in the nude?"
What did I tell you about that?
"Come on, do I look like the ''Hang'' ''Surf' sup'' kind of bride to you?"
'Cause I really think my grass skirt days are over.
"You, me, a polar bear, a judge."
"For a shower with so little water pressure, I suddenly felt a ton of it beating down on my shoulders."
"And here's the spine, right here."
Do you want to know the sex?
"I can tell you right now, if you do."
"I was lying there, the technician's giving me a guided tour of my uterus, then she tells me I'm having a boy."
"That's what this woman wanted out of me, but I couldn't get it up for her."
What exactly does a fake sonogram look like in case I ever need to do it?
Everyone else is glowing about my pregnancy.
I get the same thing every time someone hears I'm engaged.
"I'm supposed to be all excited about picking a date, and a place, and a theme."
And I just want to lie down and take a big nap.
I feel like a deadbeat bride.
"So, don't do all that stupid stuff."
I better do something soon because I'm getting the distinct feeling my Grace period is OVER.
I don't even want to look for a dress.
"You put it off and put it off, and then you finally go and afterwards you feel great."
"God, I have to go to the dentist."
I'm having a radical idea here.
There's a horrible bridal shop a couple of blocks away.
How do you even know this?
"Because every time I pass by it, I go ''blech.''"
"We could run in, you could try on the worst dress they have, just face the dragon, get it over with."
And then I'll treat you to a Tasti Delite.
It s like aversion shock therapy.
You want me to try on a bad wedding dress?
You're gonna have to do a lot better than Tasti Delite.
My friend Miranda here is getting married.
So we're looking for something special and we're in kind of a hurry.
And for Carrie here we're thinking of something with a lot of bows very frilly and poofy.
We want her to look like a giant cupcake.
"I'm sorry, which one of you is getting married?"
"And right now, Miranda has everything but the gown."
"No, it's a very straight laced, conservative crowd."
I'll see what I can find.
Your rehearsal dinner is gonna rock.
"Okay, on the count of three."
"Stop, I'm going to pee in this thing."
"Hold still, you need a veil."
You can't even tell I'm pregnant in this.
The sleeves balance out the tummy.
Don't you think it's kind of fetching?
"This is too tight, I can't breathe."
Can you get it off me?
You don't want the woman to come back in here.
There are a million buttons back here
"My God, your back is all red."
"Just get it off, just rip it off"
"I can't do it, I can't get married."
How could you take her to that dump?
My body is literally rejecting the idea of marriage.
"Once you get a rash from a guy, It s time to heave ho."
"No, it's not him, it's me."
I should be put in a test tube and studied.
"It s not just you, I don't want to get married."
Why do we even have to get married?
Aside from the not wanting to diea lone thing.
"Which is something to think about, I admit."
"For me, when it was good, it gave me a sense of security."
"You know what they say, If it ain't broke, ''"
What are you afraid would change?
Every bride feels that way at one point.
"Carrie, I'm going to ask you an unpleasant question now."
Why did you ever say yes?
"A man you love, kneels in the street and offers you a ring, you say yes."
"You get married, you hope for the best."
"It doesn't work out, you get divorced."
You can take tap with Bo Jangles here.
"No, I can't take a vow of forever and ever, if what I mean is for the foreseeable future."
I can't do that to Aidan.
How do you talk about this?
"''I've just been thinking, having some doubts about the whole 'I do' thing.''"
I should never have said yes.
"in a courtroom, reasonable doubt can get you off for murder."
"In an engagement, it makes you feel like a bad person."
"Look, everyone has anxiety around weddings."
Maybe your anxiety threshold is just lower than other people's.
You think that dress is still outside the dumpster at Tasti Delite?
After being hit by a bridal wave I tried to get my mind around the concept of happily ever after.
"As progressive as our society claims to be, there are still certain life targets we re all supposed to hit."
"Marriage, babies, and a home to call your own."
"But what if, instead of breaking out in a smile, you break out in a rash?"
Is something wrong with the system?
And do we really want these things?
"In a crisis, people always tell you to listen to your gut."
Mine was telling me to start smoking again.
But I decided not to throw it all away.
"Later, while Aidan worked on the apartment next door, I worked on reprogramming my attitude."
Could I be a spring bride?
I am having a very strong reaction to all this change.
It all just feels really fast.
I told you I was gonna come through there
It s not just the hole
I love you and I'm sorry if I'm not supposed to talk to you about this.
Just sit down on the floor.
I didn't want to say anything but then that thing came through my wall.
I don't think that I'm ready to get married yet.
You're catching me a little off guard here.
Is it because I said we could get ''Maui'd''?
Thank you for making a joke.
"Okay, how much time do you need?"
"So, you just need some time?"
Did you see the washer and dryer?
"The next day, Miranda enjoyed a few moments of solitude with her bills and her cleaning lady."
"I'm going to pay you for a whole month, okay?"
Look what I found on the kitchen counter.
Did they tell you boy or girl?
A boy is coming into the house.
"A boy is highest blessing, It s good luck."
"And while Miranda had tea for one, Charlotte was mastering Tea for Two."
We're coming across the floor with me.
"Step shuffle step for you, step shuffle step for me."
I don't want to go it alone.
"I can't do this, I'm sorry, I can't."
And this song is abusive and hurtful.
You should think about how a person would feel who's going through a very difficult divorce and who just comes here to have fun and feel good about themselves
"In her attempt to skip over her grief, Charlotte tapped into her pain."
"The next week, we all put on our finest and gathered at the Black and White Ball, Richard's charity fundraiser."
Aidan looks so handsome in a tux.
"Still a little thrown about the change in plans, but good."
I just hope I did the right thing.
That's always the right thing to do.
I'm drinking seltzer and I'm in a formal gown with an elastowaist.
Do you realize you're growing a teeny tiny penis inside you?
Two glasses of French fizz here and a sody for you.
Did you know that Miranda's having a boy?
I think I'm going to hurt myself.
"I trust you're finding something noteworthy to put in your column, J.J.?"
I can think of other places I'd like to put my column tonight.
"I'm sure you know this one, but guess which hotel king is having very private relations with a very public New York woman?"
I guess the cat's out of the bag.
It s out of the bag.
Word is they've done it in every one of his hotels.
"Samantha could handle the press, but she couldn t the truth."
"The fucking Richard is fucking the entire styles section and for the first time in my life, I actually give a shit."
I must've caught it from you people.
There are a lot of hot guys but I don't want to fuck a single one of them.
What about this guy over here?
He asked me if I knew you.
At least you're not getting divorced.
Just tell Richard how you feel.
He likes me because I'm supposed to be immune to this bullshit.
There goes that Judith Bitchy Mc Bitch heading for Richard.
"Okay, I'm going to go over there and I'm going to be completely calm, and completely professional."
"Every day, millions of people suffer from monogamy."
Exactly how many women are you fucking?
"It s the ''Black and White'' Ball, not the ''black and blue'' Ball."
"As your publicist, I must tell you all this canoodling and bed hopping is tacky and immature."
"It makes investors nervous, and frankly"
"As your publicist, yes, it does."
"Come on, we're not the monotonous, I mean, monogamous type."
"Jonesy, you get any good dish for me?"
Samantha gave J.J. an exclusive just to prove to herself that she was not.
"It wasn't the first time a guy went soft on Samantha, but it was the first time she didn't care."
"Jonesy, I can't believe this is happening."
I can give a list of women who this has never happened with.
"No, I want to, I want you to call Anna Bonnie at or Lisa Yelling at .."
"Listen, maybe I was too quick back there."
If there's anyone who could keep monotony interesting
And I wouldn't want you to.
Let's just keep things as they were.
That's a very good look for you.
I think we both look kinda sharp tonight.
"You've never looked prettier, my friend."
"Come on, you've got this beautiful white dress on, I've got this tux for another hours."
"Let's get in a cab, airport, Vegas."
"Look, if we get married tonight, we wake up tomorrow, it's done."
We don't even have to tell anybody.
"Come on, Aidan, we talked about this."
"No, you talked and I listened."
"Carrie, I looked at you tonight from across the room and I thought, I love her."
And what are we waiting for?
I don't have any tricks up my sleeve.
"I'm sorry if that scares you, but I am."
"People fall in love, they get married."
"Why can't we just keep things the way they are, just live together?"
I don't want to live together.
I want you to be my wife.
Maybe you need to be pushed.
It s just a stupid piece of paper.
"If it's just a stupid piece of paper, then why do we need it?"
I want to make this official and lock this thing down.
I want the whole wide world to know that you're mine.
You don't even wear that ring on your finger.
But I can't marry you to make you trust me.
Look at me before we make a huge mistake.
"If you don't want to marry me right now, you'll never want to marry me."
I'm gonna sleep in the other apartment tonight.
I can't believe I'm back here again.
"We had left the land of black and white, and now, everything was gray."
"To the outside world, Miranda's maternal gene might never kick in."
But that night she felt a real kick from deep inside.
There are some walls you can push through and some you can't.
That was the only night we would ever spend on the other side of the wall.
"The next day, Aidan moved out."
"A girl in pigtails once said, ''There's no place like home. ''"
But then her home didn't have a toilet that flushed for no reason...and a boyfriend who was moving out for one big reason.
You want me to fix that?
I can get someone to come and fix it.
Just let me get in there for a second.
Our last words to each other can't be ''Ball Cock.''
You should definitely stay...at least for another day.
Aidan... this is difficult to say.
I left the ring on the clown table.
"No, I should never have accepted it in the first place."
I want you to have it.
If you do or say... one more nice thing...
"I can't watch you leave, so I think I am gonna..."
Could you just... could you just shut the door?
"Three hours later, I peeled myself off the bathroom floor."
"Apparently, there were things that were difficult for Aidan to say, as well."
"I curled up to read Aidan's last words to me, also known as the goodbye letter."
He's giving her days to decide what she wants to do.
Steve and I are drawing up papers to time share our kid.
"Great love stories are supposed to end with tragedy and tears, not papers from the law firm of Gold and Vogel."
"He's asking you to buy your apartment for the exact price he paid, or you can vacate and he'll sell it."
"I'll be a bag lady, a Fendi bag lady, but a bag lady."
You should think of buying your place.
New York is a town of renters.
You got yours in the settlement.
You did not have to pay for it.
"Honey, you better learn, because that is unappetizing."
I am so swollen and gassy.
I am like a flotation device.
"I'll get this one, and I don't want a fight out of you."
Save it for your down payment.
"No, Richard gave it to me as a gift."
He is in love with you.
He is not in love with me.
Take a look at the card.
Even Gold and Vogel give you ''sincerely.''
'Best'' is like signing ''Not love.''
It s the thought that counts.
He bought you something he knew you'd love.
He's a pretty generous guy with money.
Aidan wanted me to keep the ring.
It was the right thing to do.
Do you ever think about giving yours back?
"Every time I looked at it, it would break my heart."
This ring is worth a lot.
"So, what do you want to do with it?"
I was thinking maybe I'd turn it into a necklace.
A floating diamond necklace would be to die.
"So, a lot of people do this."
"Because it turned out by husband was a faggot, now they're earrings."
We can melt down the platinum setting and turn it into spectacular earrings.
"There, in the wedding band boneyard, Charlotte started to melt down."
I don't think I'm ready for this.
Just don't take it to the gypsies next door.
Let's look at your assets here at the bank.
You may be able to use them as collateral for the loan.
It says here that you have in your checking account.
I just paid my credit card bill.
I'm sure you can appreciate my problem.
"I just broke up with my fianc?? which, trust me, is traumatic enough."
And now I have days to either find the money to buy my place or I am out on the street.
"Do you have any other income, besides the column?"
But I was chosen as New York magazine's best pick for city columnist.
I was the pick over Pete Hamill.
What about your assets outside the bank?
"I'm sorry, Ms. Bradshaw, but you are not a desirable candidate for a loan."
"After assessing what little assets I had, I realized I would have to change my lifestyle."
"Excuse me, could you tell me how much the bus is?"
"Last time I took the bus, it was like cents."
"You know, for more, you could take a cab."
Why do you have to take the bus if you're on the bus?
"So here I was, a year old single woman with no financial security but many life experiences behind me."
"After All, heartbreak and breakups are the hardest kind of work."
So shouldn't there be some sort of credit for enduring them?
"And if not, how do you retain a sense of value when you have nothing concrete to show for it?"
"Because at the end of yet another failed relationship, when all you have are war wounds and self doubt, you have to wonder, what's it all worth?"
"Let me just say again, I love your gallery, so if there are ever any openings, you have my resume."
"Meanwhile, a woman with far fewer financial worries was also contemplating her worth."
"Charlotte knew the ring didn't mean as much, now that she wasn't with Trey."
"But on that particularity low Thursday, she put on her arat diamond and wandered around her arat Park Avenue apartment."
Are you trying to spoil me?
"Why don't you slip into that, while I pour us some Crystal?"
"Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink."
Why are you doing this to me?
None of my old ones fit.
Then I'll try these for you.
"Excuse me, sir, could I try these please, in a"
"I guess, just all of these."
"But, sir, no matter what happens in the next minutes, under no circumstances am I to buy these."
I'm just trying them on for fun.
Could I try these in a nine?
"I've learned to control the sound now, but not the activity."
How'll people know to scatter without a warning?
"Although, maybe it's not that I control the noise as much as my ass is so big the sound is now muffled."
I can't even get my ring off.
"I'm telling you, the fat ass, the farting, it's ridiculous."
I am unfuckable and I have never been so horny in my entire life.
"That's why you should be married while pregnant, so somebody is obligated to have sex with you."
The lady at the bank said I was an unattractive candidate for a loan.
Where did all my money go?
"At a pop, how many of these do you have?"
I spent on shoes and I have no place to live?
I will literally be the old woman who lived in her shoes.
"When a girl gets backed up against a wall she can't afford, she has to consider renting others."
You get one of those racks that hang on the door.
I'll hang myself on a door if I have to live here.
"Delia, I ask you, how can this apartment be a month?"
I pay for something that's twice the size.
You have a rent controlled apartment.
"Unfortunately, that's really not an option."
What other shit holes are you showing me today?
"With your attitude and price limitations, I think you should consider Weehawken."
Get back to me when the numbers are in.
"Look at you, all dressed up."
So this is where you work.
It s smaller than I expected.
"I always imagined rows and rows of blondes in tight sweaters, typing."
I am here in an official capacity.
Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?
"Faced with the prospect of Weehawken, I decided it was time to call in the big guns."
"Now, what can I do for you?"
I once read that you took something like million and leveraged it to build a million building.
I want to buy my apartment but I have no money.
"You're worth a million bucks, Bradshaw."
Maybe you should go work at a bank.
So it's not just money troubles.
"Apparently, you were right, I am not the marrying kind."
"You're going to be ok, kid."
I need to know what you know about money.
I'll tell you how to get the money.
Big offered me the money for my down payment.
But I could never take it.
"When a man gives you money, you give him control."
"Someone needs it, you give it."
"You need it, you take it."
We shouldn't be talking about money.
"Like Richard, he's happy to buy me gifts, but"
"No, but he continues to send his best."
You're about to have a baby.
"And furthermore, do you have that much?"
Does no one else shoe shop?
I could loan you the rest.
Look...that is really...sweet of you two to offer.
But I'm gonna do this on my own.
So I can't tape it back.
Looks like I have gotten a job as a docent at the Museum of Modern Art.
"It s a volunteer job, but they're very coveted positions."
I didn't need a cookie to tell me that.
I'm going to save a lot of money on air conditioning.
It s been a rough two weeks.
"As I thought about leaving the apartment that I had lived in for the past decade, I realized how much I would miss it."
"Through everything, it had always been there for me."
"And suddenly, I was irrationality angry, and I knew just where and who to take it irrationality out on."
I was just in the neighborhood.
You want some iced tea or something?
Why didn't you offer me the money?
I knew you were going to say that.
Then what does it matter if I offer it or not?
Because I would have offered it to you.
My father and his friend Paul were never the same
We're not talking about your father and his friend Paul.
"We're talking about you and your friend, me."
"And for the record, I am aware that I have some financial messiness hat I have to clean up, and to that end, I am looking into some freelance magazine work."
I have been offered a word at Vogue.
"So, yes, I have made some mistakes, and, Charlotte, you have made some mistakes."
"When you were making those mistakes, I was sitting across from you at the coffee shop, nodding and listening and supporting you."
"I was not sitting at a Chinese restaurant, turning away when you should have been looking at me."
"And what kills me is, you don't even have to work."
But it's not my job to fix your finances.
You need to learn to stand on your own.
What is that on your finger?
I just wear it when I'm alone in my house.
And you're telling me to be more independent?
I can wear it if I want to.
And so what if it makes me feel better?
"And for the record, the only reason I'm volunteering is, no one will hire me."
"Apparently, I have too much experience."
"It s your ring, it s your business."
I got all worked up on the walk over here.
"No, I took a cab ride, seven blocks."
"These shoes pinch my feet, but I love them."
I am in a financial cul de sac.
But I'm going to take the bus.
I just hope I'm not on it.
"Meanwhile, in the lap of luxury"
"I'm Richard's assistant, and I'm gay."
Turn around and give a girl a moment.
"I'm Roger, and you weren't supposed to be here."
"Richard left, and I decided to take a nice relaxing bath, but now that's shot to shit."
"I am so sorry, but if it's any consolation, wow"
"So, why haven't I seen you around the office?"
Is that an errand gift wrapped on the bed?
Exactly how many women are you buying gifts for?
We're a little past acting coy.
"Since you came into the picture, a lot less."
And he's never sent me to Chanel before.
"It also came in red, but I couldn't decide"
"So, Richard didn't pick out any of these gifts?"
"Yeah, he thinks I'm the best."
"If you do one thing for me. Oh, Richard."
"Samantha could have said, ''I love you. ''"
But she was afraid it would cost her too much.
So she did what she did best.
"So every other Saturday and Wednesday at p.m, you take him."
I was thinking p.m. would be better.
"No, I just was thinking that things are gonna to get off schedule."
"I mean, we're talking about a kid, not a train."
"I'd offer to do that for you, but I don't think it's in the contract."
Don't give me a hard time.
I could fart you into oblivion right now.
But would you want to have sex with me?
"Yeah, and another charming side effect, aside from flatulence and bloating, is all I can think about is sex."
And who would want to have sex with me?
"I'd like to have sex with you, but I'm pretty sure it's not allowed."
I've read section Bin the contract and it said nothing about sex.
Fuck the contract and please fuck me.
"That night, Steve gave Miranda multiple orgasms for what it's worth."
"Just to be clear, this doesn't mean we're a couple."
I'm sorry about the other day.
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I didn't want to let go of being Mrs. Trey MacDougal.
I think you are coping amazingly well.
I want you to take the ring for your down payment.
"No, I love what the ring represented."
It would make things too complicated.
This is a straightforward business proposal.
Why do I have all this money if I can't help out a friend?
But it would be a loan.
I want you to think really carefully about this.
Will you be comfortable knowing that it will take me time to pay you back?
"Charlotte had taken her painful past and turned it into my hopeful future, and that made the ring priceless."
I start work at the museum next week.
I got Vogue up to a word.
"I fixed the toilet, and should be done with this by the end of the afternoon."
"It wasn't quite as easy as clicking my Manolo Blahniks three times, but it was worth it."
"Every morning, millions of New Yorkers leave their crowded apartments and head out to the even more crowded streets, on their way to work."
"Today, I was one of them."
"Sometimes, a girl just needs a new start."
"I had a new do, a new mortgage, and, therefore, a new job."
"I had just submitted my first freelance article for one of the most relevant and provocative magazines on the newsstands today, at least to me."
"Also known as Mecca, where I belonged."
"What Enid is trying to say, Carrie, is that you wrote a wonderful first draft."
"There it was, the article I'd put my heart and soul into and it was bleeding."
Your spin on the idea is very clever.
Different types of men as the new accessories for fall.
A Prada... ''A Prada dress should always be worn with an investment banker.''
"Julian, the assignment was words on accessories, not men."
And I'm not convinced she knows anything about purses.
"Enid, for the love of God"
"Ms. Bradshaw, what you've handed us here is essentially your newspaper column with the word ''style'' jammed in where the word ''sex'' used to be."
We're not looking for Vogue according to your agenda.
No one cares about your agenda.
I don't care about your agenda.
"Oscar de la Renta, Chanel, Dior."
I want less Carrie Bradshaw and more... ''Carry this bag with these shoes.''
Do you see what I mean?
You should be writing this down.
I was trying to find a way to introduce the bags and the bracelets with a little humor.
"Kind of, ''Men are the new black.''"
It was supposed to be funny.
It was supposed to be bags.
I didn't really bring a writing implement.
"An hour later, Enid had to leave for a lunch date, presumably to devour another writer."
Don't let Enid get to you.
She just came back from Paris and apparently humor and irony are out this season.
"Billie Holiday, the only woman I can think of in more pain than you right now."
"Come on, cookie, chin up, in publishing you need two things, a tough hide and a dry martini."
"Martinis in the morning, is this allowed?"
Last time I broke this out was when I heard that fun fur was making a comeback.
I'm afraid you've got me to blame for that.
My daughter introduced me to your column about a year ago.
I thought you'd be a natural at Vogue.
And you cookie have got vision.
We just have to find a way to hide your vision from Enid's vision.
"A little less you, a little more purse."
One and a half martinis later...
"And the sad thing is, this is what I do best."
How can anyone get so drunk on one and a half martinis?
"I didn't eat breakfast and I'm a size two, which should make me perfect for Vogue, but nope, I'm drunk and a failure at Vogue."
"Julian, I came in here today so cocky."
I thought I knew it All.
I had my men jokes and my purse puns.
What do I know about purses?
What do I know about men?
Maybe we better just take you home.
Pretend I'm saying something fantastic about corsets.
Please tell me that wasn't Anna Win tour.
"That night, at a more appropriate Cocktail hour,.."
"Come on, there must be something you want for your birthday."
What I want for my birthday is not to celebrate it this year.
What if I want to celebrate it?
Besides I have everything I need.
It s not about needing something.
It s about wanting something just for fun.
May I tempt you with dessert?
"How was everything this evening, Mr."
"I took the liberty of preordering our Chocolate souffl?? for you and Ms. Jones, if you want something sweet."
Thank you for keeping an eye on us.
You're the most attractive couple in the restaurant.
I know what I'd like for my birthday.
An all night nonstop championship fuck fest with you...
Is a three way with a year old a bad idea for Richard's birthday?
What are you gonna get him next year?
He doesn t wanna be monogamous.
He'll cheat with or without me.
He didn't ask me to get him a hooker.
"It s someone we know and at least this way, I'm part of the fantasy."
The fantasy being that he's attracted to someone young enough to be his daughter.
"He is, Charlotte, that's the problem"
Men look better as they get older and women get
"Three ways, apparently, or a Marc Jacobs ultramod little notebook."
"Evidently, I'm recommending it to Vogue shoppers."
"When a man has a fantasy and you fulfill it, there always is the chance that the relationship could blow up."
"Then you're the idiot who did it with him on the golf course, or something."
I was shopping for a stroller.
"I should be out doing all the things I'm supposed to before the baby comes, and I'm unable to leave my apartment ever again."
"Evidently, I'm to go to Crib World, because it's a whole world of cribs."
I guess Crib City wasn't big enough.
Why isn't there a store called ''This is The Crib For You''?
And they just have one great crib.
"They deliver it and assemble it, and help raise the child."
You don't have a crib yet?
"No, I have a job instead."
"I'm sorry, but when am I supposed to find time to prepare for this baby?"
I don't have a vague idea how I'm going to do any of it.
"I don't have a Vogue idea, so hello."
Why don't you let One Ball help you?
"He starts acting all father figure, and I get territorial, and the salespeople get confused."
"Trust me, it's too complicated for Crib World."
"You said you didn't want a baby shower, but you can change your mind."
"The games, the finger sandwiches, all that enforced oohing and ahing."
"I don't ooh and aah, and I don't care who's having a baby."
It d be a great way to get all the stuff you need.
Who would I invite besides you guys?
All the bitches that made you go to theirs.
You can invite or not invite whoever you choose.
Would you really want to throw me a baby shower after all you've been through this year?
"Yeah, I think it would be good for me."
"Okay, but no cutesy, storky shit."
"Just an adult, dignified lunch with presents which I will open after everyone leaves."
You have to open the presents.
"No opening of presents, no games, no crust less bread."
But it's not Super Bowl Sunday.
"It s my shower, and I'll fry if I want to."
What should we do for our gift?
Let's just stick to the registry three way.
"The next day, Charlotte decided if she was going to host a baby shower, she should hide the evidence that she had wanted one of her own."
"Later that week, I had a meal with the perfect dinner accessory, Julian."
My wife is a former dancer.
She was with the Martha Graham Company.
"And the first time I saw her on stage, I fell in love with her."
It ll be years next September.
So you got married right out of grade school.
I knew there was something about you that I liked.
Is there a man in your life?
I just broke up with somebody.
"And yes, it was a great love."
"So, Julian the reason that I asked you to dinner tonight"
Was because you knew I would pay?
"I wanted to tell you that I really appreciate your interest in my article, but I've decided not to finish it."
"So what are you gonna do, you're just going to quit?"
"No, I don't let my kids quit."
"Technically, I'm not one of your kids."
I'm just a girl you get drunk sometimes.
What would your father say about you quitting?
My father wouldn't have a whole lot to say about quitting.
He quit my mother and me when I was little.
I mean a long time ago.
And that's the name of that tune.
Your father leaves without any answers and you spend your life asking questions about men.
"What if I could fix it so that you only deal with me, and Enid spends less time hating your writing and more time hating Tom Ford's line?"
"Come on, cookie, you're no quitter."
And we get to work on this together.
Why are you being so sweet?
"Later that night, I got to thinking about fathers, or the lack of them."
Some say a daughter's relationship with her father is the model for all her subsequent relationships with men.
"Is that just pop psychology, or is there some truth to it?"
"And if you were given a less than perfect model, does it mean a life of less than perfect relationships?"
"I couldn t help but wonder, how much does a father figure figure?"
"Gentlemen, I understand your concern, but I'm looking at the contract right now."
"I'm sorry, could you hold for a moment?"
I'm on a conference call here.
Charlotte York says it's an emergency.
I'm just looking at your registry.
There are some things you forgot to include.
Active toys make for passive children.
I don't have the time for philosophy.
I'm on a conference call with our London office.
"Jesus, I have to get back."
"I know you said no storks, but I saw the most gorgeous centerpiece in the shape of a stork"
We have to order it by noon.
Its feathers are white Fiji mum.
"But these people are giving expensive gifts, and they ll want to see a little baby."
"No storks, no present opening, no cutesy baby stuff."
What about a marzipan baby carriage?
"It has a white chocolate peanut butter baby inside, and you can eat the baby."
"The next day, Samantha made a conference call of her own."
Will Mr. Wright be joining you for lunch?
"No, Actually, it's Richard's birthday this weekend and I'm trying to put together a little celebration for him."
Would you like to reserve one of our banquet rooms or
It s a very small party.
A very small private party of three.
"Just Richard, myself, and a third, if you have any openings."
"And now that Charlotte's house was ready for the baby shower, she wanted to make sure Miranda's house was ready for the baby."
The bassinet can go over here by the bed.
"So that when you get up for feedings, he's right there."
Unless you're planning to have him sleep in bed with you.
Can't I go to jail for that?
In fact many cultures believe it's safer for the baby's breathing.
Although you do run the risk of rolling over and smashing him while asleep.
"But almost it never, so if you want to err on the side of safety"
I'll just put him in the thing.
"And then when he's big enough, you can put the crib here."
Is that what you were thinking?
I hadn't thought about that yet.
"You need to start thinking about these things, cause there are a million questions to answer before the baby ever gets here."
Do you have a birthing plan?
Do you know what kind of mother you want to be?
I plan to be a good mother.
But a marsupial mom or a stroller mom?
Will you be breastfeeding or bottle feeding?
"'Cause with all the sharp edges around here, I mean, this place is a deathtrap"
"Okay, you need to back off."
This is your idea of helping?
Pointing out all the things I do badly?
"You need to try to let other people in a little, because once you have that baby, it's not just you anymore."
You're not gonna be able to control everything.
"Look, I just want to enjoy the fried chicken and be done with it."
I had to rethink the fried chicken because you re the only one who wanted all that breading.
So instead we're having mesclun greens and a lovely puttanesca with a Fiji mum center piece.
I think you can deal with one.
There s a stork on the invitation.
That duck is smoking an ''it's a boy'' cigar.
You can't have a shower without baby stuff
"You keep this stuff, and you'll have a shower without a mommy"
"I am not getting stuck with a bunch of lawyers, who, if they're anything like you, won't even appreciate a beautiful puttanesca"
Watch out for the sharp edges
Thanks for coming down and talking.
I really didn't have a choice.
You couldn't make it up the stairs.
I'm gonna be a terrible mother.
"I have no maternal instincts, no patience."
The way I yelled at Charlotte.
She was just trying to point out what needed to be child proofed.
I'm what needs to be child proofed.
"Come on, I'll quit the magazine."
Can I tell you a secret?
I dropped my niece on her head.
I was babysitting when I was and I got bored.
"I was doing my homework, she slid down the couch."
How is this kid ever gonna make it?
"A type A mother, who works hours a week, and no father figure."
"Second date, dinner and a movie."
"Hey Do you think it really can be as simple as, ''My father walked out, therefore I'll always be messed up about men?''"
"My father came home every night at on the dot, and I have no clue about men either."
Do I have to go to my own baby shower?
'd to a duck with a cigar.
I've got to catch a cab.
"Wait, let me get you a forklift."
"The next day, Miranda decided not to duck her own shower."
"Bring on the ladies in hats, and let's get this over with."
Where'd you put all the storks?
You said you didn't want any storks.
"I know, but... What did you do?"
"Cause I have to get the sandwiches, which have all of their crusts."
"No ridiculous, over the top baby stuff allowed."
Why are you opening the door?
Shouldn't you to be sitting on a lily pad being worshipped?
It s a four tiered baby cake made entirely of diapers.
What am I supposed to do with it?
How the hell should we know?
We've already been seen carrying it down Park Avenue.
Charlotte said it was the shower gift.
I told you we should've gotten the massage certificate.
"One hour, two platters of chicken, and lawyers later, all talk had turned to babies."
She may be but I have years of experience.
I could fuck her under the table.
"Because in a three way situation, it could come to that."
I have tricks she hasn't even seen.
"And no matter whatever happens, she's just renting him."
So it's more of an illegal sublet type thing?
I didn't want you coming to my office to borrow mine.
Something tells me this one's Tiffany.
That's exactly like the rattle Trey gave me when we first...
I just need to be alone right now.
"Except, you know, you've got people in the other room."
I'm sorry I ruined your shower.
And there wouldn't even be a shower to ruin if it weren't for you.
"Look, I know this is hard."
"And I really appreciate you trying to be okay with me having this baby, because I need you."
You're the only person in my life who knows how important it is to have a cake made entirely out of diapers.
And baby bottles and a receiving blanket.
I would never have known that.
"And just like that, Miranda realized she might be a good mother figure, as well."
"Somebody better go check on Mommy in the guest bath, 'cause little bits here has wet himself, and myself, I might add."
I happen to have four tiers of diapers.
"Ladies, can we cut the cake and get out of here?"
I have a three way to go to.
"That night, at the birthday three way, Samantha made sure it happened her way."
"Just so we're clear, tonight is just about sex, not love."
So there will be no kissing on the mouth.
Richard's lips are off limits to anyone but me.
There's more than enough of me to go around.
The one thing Richard didn't want for his birthday was to feel older.
It was time for the fledging to leave the love nest.
Anything else you want for your birthday?
I have a busboy arriving at midnight.
"Just you and me, nobody else."
"By giving Richard what he thought he wanted, Samantha finally got what she needed, monogamy."
"The Following night, with a little after hours help from my favorite editor, I finished the impossible, my first Vogue piece."
"And now, my favorite part of the writing process...print."
"Five hundred beautifully written words, and some of them even include the Carrie Bradshaw agenda."
It s a literary Where's Waldo?
"When I finish a piece, I usually celebrate by opening a bottle of Chateau La Tour."
"In that case, have you ever heard of the Vogue accessories closet?"
"I'm sorry, but it's... it's too good"
You're just like a kid in a couture candy store.
"Designers send these things, and we photograph them."
Do you know what these are?
We're not even supposed to be in here.
I thought these were an urban shoe myth.
"Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be pillaging the men's side."
"And if they don't fit, so help me, I'm gonna wear them anyway."
Tell me what you think of these Versaces.
"Oh, my... What are you doing?"
I'm just showing you these briefs.
Look at you in those Mary Janes
"What happened to your wife, the dancer?"
"She's having an affair with her friend, the chiropractor."
You're old enough to be my father.
"But, cookie, as someone who really cares about you, let me say, I think you have some serious issues with men."
"An older man can help you work through some of those father issues, cookie."
"It turns out Julian had an agenda, as well."
"But it was cleverly hidden, of course."
"From then on, once a month, when I went to Vogue, I thought it best to work exclusively with Enid."
"This new piece shows improvement, but still positively reeks of you."
This magazine doesn't care what Carrie Bradshaw says about shoes.
What does Carrie Bradshaw know about shoes?
"Enid, With all due respect, men, I may not know, but shoes... shoes, I know."
"I admit it's tempting to wish for the perfect boss or the perfect parent, or the perfect outfit."
But maybe the best any of us can do is not quit.
"Play the hand we've been given, and accessorize the outfit we've got."
"There is a time of year in New York when, even before the first leaf falls you can feel the seasons click."
"The air is crisp, the summer is gone."
And for the first night in a long time you need a blanket on your bed.
It brings up other needs as well.
Is this who I think it is?
Who do you think it is?
So you can understand my surprise.
I thought it was still Indian summer.
Then I guess I should take off my moccasins.
To be clear it's just to keep each other company.
I thought it was just a company visit.
This is why I'm leaving New York.
Tell that to my realtor in Napa.
"Technically, it's three quarters of it but there's a dispute over a hillside."
"Take this pizza, and put it someplace."
And if I hadn't happened to call tonight you were just going to quietly go away without telling me?
I'm not big on good byes.
The Chrysler Building would be all wrong in a vineyard.
I'm tired of old New York.
"If you're tired, you take a nap a."
"And downtown, another woman was feeling deserted."
I've eaten half a box of chocolates.
"When I get cellulite, you'll have no one to blame but yourself."
I got held up at the hotel.
I don't appreciate being kept waiting.
Especially when I have a gift for you.
"Is this an actual gift, or are we talking sex?"
It's national Richard's A Prick day.
"I saw it, and I thought of you."
It was the closest Samantha had come to giving her heart to a man in a long time.
I think it would be perfect right there.
"You kept nothing to sit on, but you have your records and a turntable?"
Shouldn't this be in a museum?
"It was my parents', and don't knock it till you've heard it."
You can't slink out of town this way.
We have to do it up right.
"And by us, I mean New York and myself."
"In that case, I hate it."
This was my parents' favorite song.
They used to put it on before they went out on the town.
"When I was little, I thought it was two twisters."
It was the ' and my parents had the moves.
"And by us, I mean you and me."
That pizza will be fantastic for breakfast.
"The next morning, I broke the Big news."
It's the end of an era.
I'm always surprised when anyone leaves New York.
A homeless man showed me his dick on the way here.
Big wasn't even going to tell you?
"He said he'd call, but what if he didn't?"
It's like the guys you have the great second date with and then never hear from again.
Should you sleep with him one last time?
Sex with an ex can be depressing.
"If it's good, you don't have it anymore."
"If it's bad, you just had sex with an ex."
Aren't you afraid that the sheer force of it all will just pull you back into all that Big stuff again?
"I love you, sweetie, but you're not giving me credit."
This is not two years ago.
"He's like this great man in my life, and he's leaving."
"I don't know how you survived any of it, Big or Aidan."
This love stuff is a motherfucker.
Did you just say love ?
"My name is Samantha, and I'm a love a holic."
"I mean, where can this possibly go?"
"No one actually makes these relationship things work, do they?"
I think they're the same people who leave New York.
I'm just really surprised Big is moving.
"You always thought what, never mind?"
I just always thought that you two would end up together.
They were never supposed to be together.
"If she was going to wind up with anybody, it was Aidan."
You don't have enough distance to have sex with your ex.
"Thanks for the sound advice, Mommy Biggest."
I haven't had sex since my ex.
"Honey, you should get on that."
It's the only way to move on.
"Later that night, I got to thinking about fate that crazy concept that we're not really responsible for the course our lives take."
"That it's all pre destined, written in the stars."
"Maybe that explains why, if you live in a city where you can't even see the stars your love life tends to feel a little more random."
"And even if our every man, every kiss, every heartache is pre ordered from some cosmic catalog can we still take a wrong step and wander off our own personal Milky Way?"
I couldn't help but wonder can you make a mistake and miss your fate?
"If you look at how brilliantly Monet suggested glimpses of sky and the luscious, tactile quality of the canvas you can see how he established his fate as one of the true poets of nature and my personal favorite."
Charlotte's fate led her to the Museum of Modern Art.
"Follow me, and we'll move on to the Pollock."
I was I love the lmpressionists.
And I'm trying to get up the courage to invite you to dinner.
"But I was just separated, and I'm not really ready to date yet."
I went through a divorce last year.
Viewing Jackson Pollock's One is an almost overwhelming
"And speaking of overwhelming exes there was Charlotte's, with his mother, Bunny."
"Mother, you have simply got to learn how to form an opinion."
"Follow me, as we move on to Paul Gauguin."
"In order to avoid her ex, Charlotte ran all the way into the Expressionist era."
"And up on the Upper West Side, two other exes were dealing with A, B and Cs."
Connect part C with bracket B and bolt
"Okay, now you're not even making sense."
Connect part C to bracket B using bolt
Aren't you gonna point out you were right?
"No, you've got pounds on me."
Did you have any other ideas?
Paul is a big name in the Brady family.
"You know, my dad and my granddad."
"But even then, Dad, you didn't even know him."
"Hey, Danny, you want to go shoot some hoops?"
We're making something for little Danny.
"Gorgeous, I've got work to do here."
"You want out of this, just say it."
"I don't want to have sex once, and I want out?"
I fucked you for three hours when we came home.
Why haven't you hung the hearts?
It's been laying against that wall for days.
I'm not sure it belongs here.
"You mean, I don't belong here."
"Samantha, a stranger to love, didn't do it very well."
"I heard the weather this morning, but they didn't say anything about a shit storm."
Where were you on your lunch hour?
"I stopped by, and you weren't there."
I saw you get into a cab with a woman wearing come fuck me heels
"Listen, Richard just tell me you're sleeping with someone else and we'll call it a day."
The hearts would be better in the den.
I had a salad and salmon.
The woman is a business associate.
I do not want out of this.
"But if you do, this is a good way to go."
I think he's doing it on his lunch hour.
I've got a wig from the Raquel Welch wig line.
And why would you be doing this?
I can't go any farther down this love road and have my heart broken.
"If he's cheating on me, I have to know now."
"Samantha, if you love him don't you think there's even the slightest chance that he might really love you, too?"
I stole a key from his cleaning lady.
I'm gonna sneak in and check his answering machine
"I do not have bail money, just so you know."
I am needing those for my last Big night on the town.
What are you two going to do?
"I meant, sex or no sex?"
I'm just getting around to picking the shoes.
Our mistake was we never really agreed on what each other wanted out of the marriage.
"My wife and I, totally different backgrounds."
And you would think we'd be able to see that was gonna be the problem.
"I mean, it's just so hard to see clearly through it."
It's like a fog or something.
"And after dinner, Charlotte invited Eric home for coffee and The and being, I'm determined to move on from my ex sex."
"Was your ex, like, a king or something?"
Look at the size of this place.
"My ex wife was an orthodox Jew, and now you're a rich girl."
Why can't I ever find a woman who's compatible with me?
I'm not really feeling that well.
It goes all the way back there.
Charlotte realized she may be ready to deal with her marriage past but not her dating future.
Contrary to popular opinion I have decided to give myself permission to sleep with Big if it feels right.
So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Can I get that in writing?
It had better stop raining before tonight.
"I have the most amazing shoes, and water will just not do."
Are you having a baby or something?
And that was just a kick.
Will you be in the room with me?
"Steve's a good coach, but he's too emotional."
I'm going to need something normal to look at.
"Okay, but I'm there purely for decoration."
I'm not cutting any umbilical anything.
"That night, after the rain, after the dinner, after the dancing I took Big for a ride."
I can't believe you actually talked me into this.
"What are you going to do out there in Napa, besides watch grapes shrivel?"
"Work, smoke cigars Iook at the stars."
Aren't you going to miss it?
"But I will miss you, kid."
I don't own a cell phone.
"Miranda gave me one, because, you know How the hell does this thing Thank you."
"Meet me at Mount Sinai, at h and Fifth."
"No, he's on his way from the bar."
I didn't think I should wait.
"I have to get out of here, to Mount Sinai."
We need to get to h Street and Fifth Avenue in a hurry.
"One short carriage ride later So, you leave tomorrow at"
I can't believe you're leaving me alone with a horse and buggy.
"Thanks for the ride, Prince Charming."
"Boy, you will do anything to stop me from having sex with Big."
"Shouldn't you be lying down, or biting on a leather strap or something?"
"I'm moving around, trying to get my water to break."
The doctor says it's better than having them break it for you.
"When this gets going, don't let anyone get all cheerleadery on me."
"I don't want any of that You can do it, push"
"And thus, with a destroyed pair of Christian Louboutins began Miranda's delivery."
And it would continue well into lunch hour the next day.
"There she was, Miss Sassy in her shag trying to catch Richard with his lunchtime shag."
"One cab ride, and a breaking and entering later Samantha found herself at Richard's bedroom door."
Turns out she was right about Wright.
But now she wished she was wrong.
Turns out the baby was almost as stubborn as Miranda.
"Okay, Miranda, one more deep breath."
"Ten toes ten fingers, two balls."
"And just like that, life comes in and things begin to change."
It's like suddenly there's a giraffe in the room.
"He's really teeny, and he has red hair."
"Oh, my God, that is so cute"
I still have a chance to catch Big.
Why are you wearing that wig?
Because my hair under it looks like shit
"Just what the world needs, another man."
"Come on, let's go see the baby"
If I ever feel lonely It was official.
Maybe our mistakes are what make our fate.
"Without them, what would shape our lives?"
"Perhaps, if we never veered off course we wouldn't fall in love, or have babies, or be who we are."
People come into your life and people go.
"But it's comforting to know the ones you love are always in your heart and, if you're very lucky a plane ride away."
"When you are single in New York, there is no end to ways to fill your days."
"Museums, parks, theatres, concert halls, nightclubs and countless restaurants."
"But one of the most amazing things about living in New York is that any night, you can go to Paris."
It was one of those perfect New York nights.
Followed by a less than perfect New York day.
He left anothern I'm sorry message on my machine
Like all the im sorrys in the world are going to make up for the fact that i caught him eating another woman's pussy
Think of this as a big purse.
You'd think after three weeks he'd get the message.
Not OK to eat another woman's pussy.
"Well i'm pissed off, What am I supposed to say?"
Fish and chips would have been an unfortunate order.
What did you do last night?
are we stil gonna have to call it date night in our fifties?
"I would just be thinking people would be looking at me thinking That poor, pathetic girl."
Like how I'm looking at you now?
You're never alone in new york it's the perfect place to be single
I wanted you to hear his tone on my machine.
"If you keep participating, you might as well call him."
It's tragic you were in love and it didn't work.
"You have to emotionally cut him out and the sooner, the better."
Everyone knows you only get two great loves.
I read it in a magazine
Convenient Theories For You Monthly ?
"It means last year When you were married,"
you believed in one great love.
Yeah and that phrase great love what does that even mean?
"it means a love that changes you, that shakes you to your core, after which you're never the same."
There is not unlimited love in the world.
Way to take the edge off a club sandwich.
So far I've had one Trey.
refuse to define love in those limited terms
"No, it was a stupid article."
"No, it's too late for that."
She had two loves and lots of shoes.
"I gave you sushi , I need fuck ."
"After a light lunch, Miranda stopped to set down a heavy load."
You want me to carry him?
"no no no i'm fine, i've just got to switch"
I pray when I turn around there are sailors.
We have just spotted our first sailors.
"Fleet Week is that one week a year when the US Naval ships dock, and our fair city is made even fairer with cute, sweet, American sailors looking for fun."
I've been so distracted by Richard.
I almost forgot my favourite holiday.
I'm gonna find out about the big party.
We always have fun when we go
"Me, Running through Times Square in heels trying to find a sailor to kiss?"
"That ship has sailed, pun intended."
We have to to show them a good time
It's our patriotic duty as women of New York.
"If you want to do your patriotic duty as New York women, you will come shopping and throw some much needed money downtown."
"Well, let's get you a cab home."
Miranda suddenly found herself moving slowly away from her old life.
And quickly into her new one.
"You keep doing the thing, the mirror."
The nurse will put him down for a nap.
"Hi, what are you doing here?"
came over to hang with B boy.
I've gotta get Brady down for a nap or he won't sleep tonight.
"Lina, would you get Brady ready for his nap?"
And don't talk to Steve about my nipples.
You just randomlyy asked about my nipples?
yeah I talk about your nipples to strangers all the time.
I appreciate that but I've hired help.
"Have a good evening, Mrs MacDougal."
"Charlotte realised she may have put great love number one behind her, but his name was still in front of her."
"Bad for the heart, good for the economy."
I'll keep calling till you agree to talk.
"Unless you want messages every day, meet me tonight."
"In a wildly optimistic gesture, I ordered you a dirty martini."
"I have always wanted to do that, but I don't think I could."
But I woke up this morning even angrier.
I need to hurt him more.
I can't be around that man.
I wonder what he was gonna say.
"That he loves me, we belong together, he didn't mean to hurt me."
He gave me a second chance.
I'm not doing the baby talk at breakfast.
"I signed up for friendship, not bullshit baby brunches."
"She had a baby, not a loboTomy."
She knows you're not child friendly.
Days of pussy and fuck are gone.
"Later that night, I got to thinking about days gone by."
That carefree time when our schedules were as open as our hearts.
The time before the baggage and babies began to weigh us down.
"I couldn't help wonder, does that sense of adventure still flicker inside us?"
"Or when it comes to being carefree single girls, have we missed the boat?"
"I'm a friend of Hi, this is Lina."
Were we supposed to do something and I forgot it?
"No, I had the day free and thought I'd stop by for a chatty."
I brought some pain au chocolat.
"Thanks, but the only eating I'm concerned with now is Brady."
I've been trying to feed him for an hour and he won't latch on Stop.
"Well, I've been thinking about that thing that Charlotte said in the coffee shop."
"So maybe Aidan and Big are my two great loves, now."
But that doesn't mean that that I'm always gonna feel that way about them.
"There, in the middle of my two great loves, were Miranda's two great breasts."
"Sweetie, they're looking right at me."
I am not gonna become one of those mothers who cannot carry on an adult conversation.
"Three weeks ago, I would've been listening and saying funny things."
I didn't get the anorexic joke.
Could Samantha have gotten me into that cab faster?
"Carrie, my friendships are important to me."
Things will have to change a little.
But you're still one of us.
"Only now, you're the one with the biggest boobs."
Can you believe the size of my nipples?
"Please, I was not at all prepared."
I'm gonna have to find some trauma counselling.
Let you concentrate on Mr Hobbes.
What are you going to do all day?
"Well, first a trip to the Guggenheim and then lunch and then"
You listened and we had the witty repartee.
"That same afternoon, Charlotte felt like going to a movie."
"She called her afternoon movie friend, Anthony."
Carrie says the French film at The Paris is amazing.
Like I need to spend an afternoon looking at that shit.
What do you want to see?
"He's cute, with a capital 'U' He totally checked you out."
What am I going to do with him?
"Put an end to that Park Avenue, pink shirt, flaccid mojo"
I changed my name back to York on my mailbox.
Maybe you should be thinking about a different box.
When did you last have sex?
"If you have to think, it's been too long."
I'm not looking for just sex.
I'm looking for my next great love.
yeah well Don't let it hit that six month mark.
"After that, it's a sleigh ride into menopause."
"If you don't put something in there soon, it will grow over."
What is it with this friggin' wind?
"As Charlotte and Anthony made a left, Samantha found herself in the right neighbourhood, Richard's."
It's against city law to deface public property.
"This man said he loved me, and I caught him eating another woman's pussy."
"New York weather, like a man, can be unpredictable."
But that's part of the fun.
"And a New York museum, like a man, can sometimes be closed when you wish they were open."
That's another reason I love New York.
"Just like that, it can go from bad to cute."
"Well, I guess we're not going anywhere for a while."
I love the way the rain smells.
"If this were a French movie, we'd fall in love and get married."
"No, I was just pointing out how romantic this would be in a movie."
I don't want to marry you.
I don't want to get married.
"I was engaged last year, and if I didn't want to marry him"
"I was hoping to get a table Singles, counter."
"Several blocks later, I decided to warm up with a bowl of matzo ball soup."
I put up with it because I come here all the time.
We single gals got to have a port in a storm.
I like to sprinkle it on my ice cream.
"No, can't say that I have."
What kind of mood elevator are you on?
I used to be like you.
Then I broke up with this guy.
Thought somebody better would come along.
"If Charlotte was right, this woman's two great loves were a man named Morty and lithium laced ice cream."
"After minutes squatting under the coffee shop hand dryer, I realised I'd been kidding myself."
New York and I didn't have the perfect relationship.
"It was dismissive, abusive, and it made me feel desperate."
I was now fresh out of great loves.
This is Bill Hope and Paul Watkins.
We'd like to invite you to a navy party tonight.
Feel free to bring some girlfriends.
I don't know why I was fighting it.
Three single gals back on the town.
What's the longest you've gone without sex?
oh no You don't get that info without dinner and a drink.
Next week will be six months.
She threw me and I lost my concentration.
I am gonna have sex with a sailor tonight.
She almost got me on that one.
I have to have sex to put Mrs Trey MacDougal behind me.
How are we gonna find your sailor?
The important thing is to stick together or we'll get lost.
"And uptown, another woman found herself in a confusing navel situation."
"I'm prepared for the expected, but not the unexpected."
I can't schedule shit like this.
And the people you hire won't help you
"He may not be a core shaker, but Steve was there when she was shaken to the core."
This party's like the Bermuda Triangle for women.
You remind me of my mom.
"Meanwhile, I had not found Charlotte, but Charlotte had found an officer who wasn't a gentleman."
"The old Charlotte would've had him court martialled, but the new one"
I was just looking for you.
Charlotte was caught somewhere between the old and new York.
She figured showing her boob to a stranger bought her three months.
"Believe it or not, she's involved in a peep show upstairs."
I'm starting to have a new found respect for that girl.
"I've seen Miranda's boobs, Charlotte's boob."
Why not show me yours and get it over with?
That ought to hook me a sailor.
"This ship has sailed and tragically, I'm still on it."
"Hey, keep an eye on Boom Boom up there."
"I came, I saw, I'm leaving."
I've come all the way from Louisiana to dance with a New York city girl.
Even though she was floating in a sea of dickies
one new message and saved messages
Samantha could only think about Richard.
You threw a drink in my face and papered my neighbourhood.
Would I still call if I didn't really love you?
You threw a drink in my face and papered my neighbourhood.
Would I still be calling if I didn't really love you?
"Say, Louis from Louisiana, how many great loves do you think you get in a lifetime?"
That is the question on deck.
"After this city kicked my ass today, I needed that dance."
"I have to say, this is my first trip to New York."
I don't know how you put up with it.
"If Louis was right, and you only get one great love, New York may just be mine."
I can't have nobody talking shit about my boyfriend.
"A short while later, I had a thought."
Maybe the past is like an anchor holding us back.
Maybe you have to let go of who you were to become who you will be.
The worst thing about not being in a relationship is when your job is to write about being in a relationship.
"Remember that guy who wore sandals, Randal the sandal guy?"
We had a couple of dates.
No but I'm scraping the botTom of the barrel.
last week I wrote about my search for the perfect French fry.
"You didn't read it, did you?"
I don't always have time to read your columns
Even my friends find me irrelevant.
You have a little man hanging from your breast.
What else are you gonna do?
They'll have to change my column to And The City .
You're on the side of a bus.
There for I'm getting laid off.
"I don't know if you read the rest of the paper, but people with real jobs are getting laid off."
This is not a good economy in which to be whipped cream.
Last night I started writing about my sock drawer.
You and I need to find some men.
You have to know where to look for them.
I'm not trawling for men to have something to write.
I can only help with baby proofing.
i'll tell you how to baby proof.
The veggie scramble and wheat toast.
Maybe I'll make it a two parter.
"Richard, whose death we've been plotting?"
Wow Maybe there are no men.
I finally listened to what he had to say and
I've never known anyone like you.
I was in over my head.
okay That coming from you is almost as disturbing as the news itself.
"I get scared, I hide under the covers, not between somebody's legs."
You'll have to be there so he doesn't get scared again.
Being scared is not easy for a man to admit.
They get a medal for identifying a feeling?
We do that all day long.
I understand that Richard is a charismatic and successful man.
An interesting pussy might cross his path and he might fall It's just sex.
That migh be a flaw in him but you know what?
Some women can't get their husbands to pick up the dry cleaning.
You're comparing not picking up the dry cleaning with Do the thing.
I believe he'll try his best.
That's your choice and we should all respect it.
"Now, How about this for a column?"
Desperate Women Who Will Believe Anything .
"The next day, two parents covered outlets to prevent their baby from getting shocked."
I was thinking Maybe we want to get Brady baptised.
"For grown ups, there is no such safeguard."
Neither of us goes to church.
"I was baptised, my father, my father's father."
It would mean a lot to my ma.
You never had a mother when we were going out.
This is the first I've heard of her.
You are just making a case for religion.
It's not about religion or God.
It's something you do in case So baby don't end up in limbo.
You don't know what that means.
"A place where babies fly around without bodies, just wings under their neck."
That sounds like something we should worry about.
"Brady isn't crawling, and you've got us baby proofing this apartment."
But you won't let someone sprinkle water on him so he doesn't go to hell?
"Miranda didn't believe in hell, except the hell she was in right now."
This is why I was worried about involving you.
Why should I go through some ceremony to make your ma happy?
If you don't believe It's just water on the kid's head.
I wouldn't put it past you.
What's to stop you getting scared every time a hot woman walks by?
I don't give a shit what they think.
"I love you, and I've got something for you."
Now it was Samantha's turn to be scared.
"It's not for that finger, it's for this one."
"When you flip me off, I'll have something shiny to look at."
"A canary diamond, I'll try not to cheat and eat when I'm scared ring."
Samantha wasn't sure if she was in heaven or limbo.
"Meanwhile, I was clearly in hell."
"That afternoon, Charlotte and I went trawling for men."
It's like a road trip game for urban singles.
"Watch the men coming your direction, and see how many out of you'd sleep with."
"okay yes, out of where are you?"
"zero, What about the guy with the dog?"
I don't like dachshunds for men.
"Can't handle a real dog, can't handle a real woman."
"Men who are too good looking are never good in bed, because they never had to be."
There must be someone you'd have imaginary sex with.
You have slept with eight men and we have only had appetizers.
You should come with me to Dr Cheryl Grayson's seminar.
There's time for questions and answers.
She has a new haircut and I hear it's cute.
Why would I go to that?
It's kind of a catch isn't it?
You might get a column out of it.
I think you'll really enjoy it.
Her philosophy of written affirmations has helped me let go of negative thoughts.
Aren't you Carrie Bradshaw from The New York Star ?
I'm glad I ran into you since you don't return your calls.
But I am just now researching my next column.
I think it's going to be super fun and sexy.
We sit here and pick how many men out of we would sleep with.
"No one's asking to fuck every guy in town, We're only a weekly paper."
I've been trying to get in touch An editor from Clearwater Press called.
They're interested in turning your columns into a book.
I'm having a Cosmopolitan with the woman who wrote about them.
If only I could find a man.
Have you considered writing about that?
"The next night, I met publishing powerhouses Lily Martin and Courtney Masterson."
All of us at Clearwater Press read your column religiously.
I have Ten Men To Avoid on my refrigerator.
But not in that icky Cathy comic way.
I predict this book will be huge.
Because There are so many single women desperate for something like this.
You already have an inventory of columns to choose from.
Some we don't have to include.
"That one on French fries didn't make the fridge, did it?"
"We want to fast track it, get it on the shelves by ChristmasHanukkah."
"You can pick the columns, about or"
Write an introduction and dedication to clarify the tone.
So you mean What do you mean?
Just here are my favourite columns?
"Yes, but also, is it hopeful?"
Is Carrie Bradshaw an optimist or pessimist?
"yeah, What's your point of view?"
After the break ups and disappointments and train wrecks.
"You still believe he's out there, right?"
Or should we shoot ourselves now?
"To be honest, I wasn't sure what I believed."
But my cynical side suspected optimism would sell more books.
My best friend is going to be a published author.
"It's so fabulous, it makes me more fabulous."
I enjoy being under the radar.
"I take comfort in the fact that many people, present company included, don't see my column."
I'm waiting till it's in hardback.
I hope it's big and glossy.
Everyone who's anyone has a book.
I'm not sure what you just said because I was blinded by a piece of jewellery.
"I think it's his way of saying, I'm sorry."
"Wow What do you get if it happens again, the Hope diamond?"
The hope that fucker doesn't break my heart again diamond.
evidently We were both turning our pain into gold.
"That night, I started to think about belief."
Maybe it's not advisable to be an optimist after the age of
"Maybe pessimism is something we have to apply daily, like moisturiser."
"Otherwise, how do you bounce back when reality batters your belief system and love does not, as promised, conquer all."
"Is hope a drug we need to go off of, or is it keeping us alive?"
Repeat your affirmations daily if you want to let love into your life.
Breathe in the possibility of love.
What is not love is fear.
Let go of your fears and embrace your dreams.
"Miranda wasn't a believer, but her faith was renewed when she found a church that seemed to suit her and a suit that seemed to fit her."
I told you she'd probably leave him with the nurse.
"Mrs Brady, so nice to meet you."
I wanted to wear my nice dress.
But the dry cleaners doesn't open until
"I was hoping that you'd bring Brady, since I haven't seen him yet."
"Well, Stevie gave me a picture I've been carrying around in my wallet."
I should've put it in a frame.
"I Xeroxed it at the phone company, and everyone in my division said he looks like me."
I'll see him at the ceremony.
"I'm grateful to be included, especially since you aren't Catholic and didn't want to have a christening."
But the idea of this baby burning in hell
"I'm just saying my oldest son, Jackie, had a baby who died, two weeks old."
"Thinks I have a problem with her, but I don't."
Maybe the priest doesn't need to know you aren't getting married.
We're not lying to the priest.
"Yes, we spoke on the phone."
I go to Saint Agnes in Queens.
"No, just a couple of beers."
I don't want the baby referred to as Catholic.
It's not that she's a fan of Satan.
She doesn't want to talk about him.
"In fact no mention of Satan, the devil"
"Miranda was surprised the priest was so flexible, but in troubled times, the Catholic Church is like a desperate, willing to settle for anything it can get."
This is not what I had in mind when you asked to go dress shopping.
He has to get baptised and wear a dress.
It's about cleansing this little baby of his sins.
Babies come into this world with a clean slate.
I have to figure out if I'm an optimist or a pessimist.
I don't know what I believe.
One less bath i have to give him?
I didn't meet his mother till yesterday.
"Imagine Steve, in a wig, drunk."
"So listen, How would you feel about being Brady's godmother?"
What would I need to do?
"Officially, you provide the baby with spiritual guidance.Unofficially, you stand with me so I have somebody to roll my eyes at."
And there's cake from some bakery in queens.
The sugary kind with the thick icing?
"That night, Charlotte dragged me to the fountain of belief."
"Apparently, women are the main market for hope."
Saying no would get us off on the wrong foot.
I believe in the good in people.
Are you going to make fun of everything?
Helped pick a christening gown for my friend's illegitimate baby.
"Oh, I'm so happy she decided to do a baptism."
She asked me to be the godmother.
I know friendships that ended because someone was a disappointing godparent.
Did you want to be the godmother?
It wouldn't kill you to acknowledge that some things are sacred.
Let me know when we're talking.
I believe this is going to be a very long evening.
I believe we are the only normal people here.
"I believe in the good in Charlotte, who dragged me here against my will when I wanted to stay home and just be negative."
What does the gown look like?
"You're trying to make me feel bad, but that turns me on."
You're going to Miranda's baptism with me Sunday.
"It'll be all day, it'll be boring, it'll be mandatory."
Are you going to do the thing again?
"Although he appeared to have reformed, Samantha wasn't ready to forgive his sin."
Love will come to you only when you truly believe you deserve it.
"Meanwhile, an hour and affirmations later"
"Love will raise you up, Fear will pull you under"
The affirmations have really worked for me.
"I prayed for love, I believed in love, and last week I fell in love."
"He's perfect and kind and giving, and I now know that I deserve that."
Did you want to say something?
I was wondering Hi I'm wondering how long that woman was doing her affirmations.
I've been doing mine every day.
"I want to believe, but nothing is happening."
I just don't think it's working.
I don't think it will work for me.
You have to believe love to receive love.
Your heart will catch up with your head.
I believed there was someone out there for me and I met him finally.
"We had a beautiful wedding, and then everything just fell apart."
I'm afraid that he took away my ability to believe.
I hate him for that because I always believed before.
And now I just feel lost.
"And I am, I'm trying to put myself out there but I feel hopeless."
Perhaps you're not really putting yourself out there.
Maybe you're not looking for love in a real way.
Maybe you're not really out there.
"Sunday afternoon, we gathered for a baptism in the little church that would."
"Hey, you, with the flower thing."
Steve tells me you're the godmother.
"I'm the godfather, Steve's second cousin, Patrick."
"Oh Someone who isn't related to Steve, no offense."
I didn't want Brady to show me up.
I think your baby's godfather baptised himself with some bad cologne.
Brady's grandmother invited the folks from Molly McGuire's.
I know your hands are full with the drunk and the skunk.
I have to tell you something.
I'm too fat to be wearing this aren't I?
"No, oh no, you look beautiful."
Are you sure that I am godmother material?
Shouldn't you pick someone a bit more maternal?
"No, I like that you're not."
I don't know my own view of the future.
I'm possibly one bad date away from bitter.
Don't you think I'm getting a little cynical?
"Charlotte's dying for the job, and I think she'd be better at it."
"I don't know if I believe in any of this, but I believe in you."
I want you to be my baby's godmother.
"Well, I did spring for the hat."
Who presents this child to receive the sacrament of Baptism?
"Give him an enquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to persevere, a spirit to love, and the gift of joy and wonder."
"In the Lord's name, we pray."
"In baptism we use your gift of water, which you have made a rich symbol of the grace you give us in this sacrament."
"Through it, you led the children of Israel out of their bondage."
There isn't enough holy water in the world to cleanse you.
"Brady, I baptise you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
I hoped the water would wash away some of my original cynicism.
Isn't this the most beautiful goddamn Catholic you've ever seen?
But he's a cute fucking kid.
You got me to a church.
"Just for the record, I did get scared."
Maybe things will work out between them.
"That night, I dedicated my baby my book to hopeful single women everywhere, and one in particular my good friend Charlotte, the eternal optimist, who always believes in love."
"When venturing out on your first blind date in a decade, it's crucial to have the right attitude."
"Prepare for the worst and who knows, you might be pleasantly surprised."
"Yes, deigned to go on a blind date against my better judgment."
I was willing to lower myself into the gutter.
Either he didn't show or took one look at me and ran.
I'm sure we'll get to the botTom of this.
You shouldn't be going on blind dates.
I know great couples that met on blind dates.
"Even if he had shown, first dates are like interviews with cocktails."
I said that yesterday about bread.
"Why should I risk having a god awful evening, when I am guaranteed to have fun with you guys?"
"Honey, you're cute, but I'm never gonna fuck you."
I'm sorry this happened on your first date back.
"I came out, I saw my shadow."
You have to take risks so you don't wind up an old maid.
Must not wind up old maid.
Why do we get old maid and spinster and men are bachelors and playboys ?
No matter how shrivelled their dicks are.
Charlotte's h birthday is Saturday night.
I say we spinsters take back Manhattan.
I've thought about it and I've decided I'm sticking at
It was such a good year?
I'm not where I thought I'd be at
Men are more interested in meeting
We all turned like big girls.
Lying about her age is the smartest thing she's done in years.
"Where are we celebrating Charlotte's h birthday, the sequel?"
Today is the baby nurse's last day.
"Now, you have to book me in advance."
Richard's taking me to Atlantic City.
There's a heavyweight fight he wants to see.
We are going on his private jet.
No celebration is fine with me.
The four of us can't get together for Charlotte's faux birthday?
"Two nights later, with no friends, no dates, not even any good bad TV to watch This is bullshit."
"OK, this is my third and final phone call."
Miranda thinks she can get Steve to watch the baby.
Charlotte agreed as long as we don't mention her birthday or
I'm still a little fuzzy on the rules.
Can't you get out of Atlantic City?
I am looking at the last picture taken of us and it is mouldy.
Miranda is wearing a blouse with shoulder pads.
Carrie's hell bent on getting the four of us together Saturday.
Would you be terribly disappointed if I didn't come?
"That Friday, I picked up my fellow jet setter on the way to the airport."
Under the boardwalk We'll be having What?
I'm not ready to be separated from the baby.
Steve took him two hours ago.
You want to see something beautiful?
You ever see such beautiful face?
"As I live and breathe, Ms Hobbes, I never thought I'd see the day."
I didn't take most of those.
This is my only sweater that covers my ass.
Can I get away with this and stretchy pants?
Atlantic City is the capital of stretchy pants.
"I thought I forgot the Wipies, but turns out actually"
I don't think I can do this.
I'm afraid that I might break him.
I accidentally scratched his face with my dirty fingernail.
You've taken care of him before.
"Yeah, but for two hours I'm great."
"After two hours, I might accidentally kill him."
We're both afraid we're going to kill the baby.
We made an agreement this week.
"Monday to Friday, I try not to kill him."
"Saturday and Sunday, you try not to."
The four of us are going to Atlantic City.
"So, it's just going to be the three of us for the whole flight?"
"Ooh, it's pretty But what is it?"
That was actually meant for Samantha.
Did I tell you I've taken up knitting?
What will they think of next?
"Knitting is the new yoga, according to New York Magazine ."
"Maybe later, I'll give you a pearl necklace to match."
My father gave me a beautiful pearl necklace for my sweet sixteen.
We're talking about the other kind of pearl necklace.
"You know, when a guy decorates your neck?"
You're sure that Carrie said they were coming down tonight?
"Knit one, purl two would never sound the same to Charlotte again."
I need to go somewhere that I've been looking forward to
Magda has offered to help Steve.
Throw some money at the problem.
This is the final call for Atlantic City.
Passengers should board for immediate departure.
I think we're on the old lady express.
Where are all the old men?
Dead or married to year olds.
I have been dreaming about being alone with these.
I love that The New Yorker is your porn.
Will we still be friends when we're this old?
"What do you mean, sure ?"
I could barely get us together for the weekend and we're all mobile.
"Hey New Yorker , I'm talking to you."
How are we gonna make it to if you've already zoned me out?
Friendships don't magically last It's like savings.
You don't expect to wake up when you're old and find a big bucket of money.
Did you finally open that IRA?
"My point is, we need an emotional retirement plan."
"This is important, making time for each other and taking trips like this."
"As we can see, at the end of the line, it's gonna be us ladies riding a bus."
"Two New Yorker magazines and two knit booties later, we all arrived at the understated Taj Mahal casino."
Breathe deep and take it all in.
I thought you've never been here.
You should've been on the bus.
A little harmless over the bra action and Miss Prissy here is running for a parachute.
Have you heard of a pearl necklace?
I told Richard I'd stop by.
We'll take care of that later.
"Right now, I'm taking my ladies to dinner."
Nothing is too fancy for my Atlantic City ladies.
We have got to get a picture here.This place is fantastic
Is that a euphemism for tacky?
Is it bad to order more sour cream?
I almost forgot about Charlotte's present.
"It's Tomorrow, and I said I didn't"
"Relax., it was in the gift shop for"
Is this supposed to be funny?
uou couldn't be farther from an old maid.
I remember her looking a lot older.
She looks about our age now.
So here's where the bathing beauties are hiding.
My poker game's starting.Would you like to join me?
I think I'll stay with the girls.
"Richard, welcome back to the Taj Mahal."
Five gentlemen are waiting to take my money.
It's part of the regional charm.
May we always I think I will join Richard.
"Ladies, would you like the souvenir photograph?"
It was supposed to be the four of us.
Now one of us has a puss on.
That's why you should leave now.
No one's offered us drinks yet.
I don't know how to play.
"I want you, my lucky blonde."
"You just won me grand, blondie."
Are you going to gamble it?
It could be a lot more.
What have you got to lose?
That would not make me happy.
What would make us happy is to see ZZ Top in the Magic Carpet Room.
I've got pay per view and a frozen Milky Way in my room.
A minute ago you were bouncing off the walls.
"I stop for a minute, I have to lie down."
You You can't go to sleep.
In five minutes Charlotte turns again.
Charlotte went to sleep that night with a chip on her shoulder.
"The easier a game is to understand, the greater the house edge."
"The house edge on all bets is for points Except for zero, double zero, which Carries a house edge of"
"People go to casinos for the same reason they go on blind dates hoping to hit the jackpot.But mostly, you wind up broke or alone in a bar."
"If we know the house always wins, why gamble?"
"Next morning, Richard and Samantha awoke in the Kublai Khan suite."
How long will you be with the girls?
"Apparently, there were no old maids at the Taj Mahal."
Terry with her terry cloth towels.
Samantha had the distinct feeling she was being Kublai conned.
"You're not jealous of a casino cleaning lady, are you?"
It's impressive you know the name of every woman who works here.
I know the male employee's names.
Doesn't mean I'll sleep with them.
"Can I get you some towels, a chocolate for your pillow?"
"Yes, but not necessarily in that order."
"Meanwhile, Charlotte's encore There she was, an old maid."
"Three hours later, I was waiting for our foursome to come together."
I've been fucking Richard for three hours.
There are cheap looking whores flying at him from every direction.
"No, but I think Harlot is."
"I didn't like what I packed, so I picked something at the casino shop."
Those are for women who have lost their money and have to turn tricks.
No wonder the house always wins.These guys are smothered in breasts.
What was I thinking bringing a cheating man to Atlantic Titty.
You've gotta play big to win big.
"Ma'am, would you like a hit?"
It's all part of the fun.
You're sitting on Don't make me hit the ATM again.
"If you're not playing, you'll have to give up your seats."
Would you mind taking our picture first?
i'm not allowed to do that ma'am
"Hey, Red, move your fat ass"
What did you just say to her?
Who the hell do you think you are?
Get in the game or get out.
It is most certainly not OK
Her ass isn't normally this big.
"My ass is fat because I just had a baby, you asshole."
"The Lennox Lewis match sold out that night, but our heavyweight fight caused a bigger stir."
I think I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'll go with one of the girls.
He had a sudden conference call and he can't go to the fight.
So he can get serviced by room service.
"Under other circumstances, running stairs in a pearl thong would have been Samantha's idea of a good time."
"By the eighth floor, somewhere between pissed off and getting off, she had to take it off."
I can't do this any more.
I ran up flights of stairs because I was sure you were fucking someone.
"As you can see, I'm not."
But you were and you will again.
I can't spend my life running up and down stairs wondering when.
"I thought I could handle this, but I can't."
"I told you I'd do my best never to hurt you again, and I meant it."
"I love you too, Richard, but I love me more."
"And there, high above the casino, Samantha pulled her highest bet, her heart, off the table."
Just when Samantha thought she might have folded too soon
"One drink here, then we should see the boardwalk before it's dark."
"Hey, can we buy you a drink?"
Can you just wait one second?
What is the point of this?
"Can I have a word with you, alone?"
The one in the black's cute.
I didn't leave Manhattan to double date two guys we'll never see again.
You didn't even talk to them.
I would rather have a real conversation with you.
out of the dark and into the light.
It's like a postcard from the '.
What's the harm in one drink?
I can't believe you're still upset.
What role did you think they were going to play in our lives?
We might have hit it off.
How many guys do we ever hit it off with?
"Very few, and even if we do, those relationships don't last."
"Even if they did, men die first."
I say we skip all the drama and enjoy each other's company now.
But I don't want to skip all the drama.
That's relationships and anniversaries and kids.
"I want all that, in addition to my friends."
"That sounds wonderful, but don't bank on it happening."
I'll meet you back at the hotel.
I'm going to get some saltwater taffy.
"By my fifth piece of peppermint taffy, I realised maybe I wasn't banking on my friends."
Got your bathing suit on under there.
I was hoping for a skinny dip.
There is nothing skinny about either of us.
"Then again, maybe there are some things worth gambling on."
"Back inside, I had a thought."
"To hit the jackpot in the future, you might have to bet on where you are in the present."
"Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets."
I guess you fall off the table.
Well I can't believe you gambled all that money.
We could be in a limo.
I thought we were taking the jet.
You couldn't have broken up Tomorrow?
Don't let me have any more of these.
Anyone up for playing Old Maid?
Would you mind taking our picture?
This is the moment we'll want to remember.
it is said that it takes a lifetime to figure out who you are.
This book cover is so you.
People in publishing move a tad faster.
We put your head on another body.
The cover of Sex And The City .
The bestselling Sex And The City .
We don't want the reaction to be no .
Let me talk you through it.
You naked with nothing but your ideas.
"But no matter how fast paced the city, I always manage to get my clothes on before I leave the apartment."
That cover is all about sex.
Yes My columns are about relationships.
"When I write about sex, it's just words."
Reading about sex is different than seeing it in front of you naked on h Avenue hailing a cab.
OK Let me see it again.
"The next day, our talk turned from bachelors, baby bottles and Balenciaga blouses to books."
And you know the scary thing?
What could anyone say about you?
"But if I get the wrong book cover, I'm a fabulous target."
How do you see yourself on the cover?
"Like a writer who happened to have wound up on her book cover looking smart, sexy and properly airbrushed."
"Next Thursday, but I can't afford you."
"True, my PR services are pricey."
It'll cost you two martinis and a lunch.
"OK, I'll talk to my people."
What kind of a diet book are you looking for?
Something like How To Lose That Baby Fat By Sitting On Your Ass .
"As soon as I finish this nougat, caramel, pretzel thing."
I'm gonna go look for this book I read about.
"As Charlotte looked at the titles: The Women's Comfort Book , The Path To Love , Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting , Please Understand Me ll , she couldn't bear the thought that she belonged there."
"It's none of my business, but don't do that."
Can The New York Times pry the cookie dough out of your hands?
Where's Starting Over Yet Again ?
"Who needs the self help aisle when you can self help yourself to amazon.com and get exactly what you need, overnight express and shame free."
"Want to sign right here, please?"
I just got my nails done.
Would you mind opening my package?
"Now, maybe I can help you with your package."
At exactly I stopped by to pick up Samantha for our business lunch to decide what we thought was sexy.
"Some women, like Samantha, know when to stop putting things in their mouths, while others, like Miranda, need a little help."
There's been a mistake on my weight.
The other woman inverted the numbers.
"If I'm gonna do this, I want to do it right."
Can I scooch in a minute?
You wrote down this woman weighs
Could you not yell out my weight?
Here you go and here's a name tag.
We've all got to wear these.
"Later that same day, Stanford came over for a fag and some flipping."
Finish that and get over here and start on Vogue .
Tear out any outfit that might work for me.
Something that won't be too pathetic if I wind up in the half off bin.
I adore a metal breastplate on a man.
"Before I tell you, you have to promise not to judge."
Some people do arts and crafts.
I feel as though my hands are tied.
"He's a Broadway calibre dancer, working in the male chorus."
"Last Christmas, he danced the part of Arabian Coffee in The Nutcracker ."
You met a man who played coffee waiting to get coffee?
"What is that, a new zodiac sign?"
How funny was that in my office?
I'm sending you the X ray bill for my elbow.
Could you have gotten out any faster?
I got my favourite stylist to pull some looks for the cover.
Did you tell them what we're looking for?
"You still want me to do this, right?"
I'll have them pull some stuff.
"No, but he's gay and bitchy."
Look at some outfits for the cover.
I'll have to check with Marcus.
"You're not gonna turn into one of those couples, are you?"
"I think it's pretty much agreed that it goes open minded: good, judgmental: bad."
But are we being too quick to judge judgment?
Perhaps judgment is not so much a snap decision as an early warning and detection device.
"If it is instantly clear that a person, place or profession is not for you, is it better to ignore your better judgment and read between the lines or should you judge a book by its cover?"
"Based on your recent book purchase, here's a list of books you might be interested in."
"The selected list included Lonely Women No Men , Love Hurts."
"You Don't Have To , I'm Fine Now and Reservations for One ."
Charlotte refused to see herself as one of those women.
It fell eight flights and landed at the feet of a woman contemplating divorce.
She considered it a sign from God.
"After three Weight Watchers meetings, where they did nothing but talk about eating, Miranda Baby Weight and Tom Big Boned went someplace to eat."
"Then I did the one where you only have water, eggs and grapefruit."
It worked out well until I fainted on an Indian woman in the subway.
"What about the one with the pre packaged, chemicalised food?"
How do they get all of those artificial ingredients into such tiny packages?
Although they did have this itty bitty thing of tuna that I loved.
I cut my tongue licking it out of the can and knew it was time to stop.
Ever try the cabbage soup diet?
"No, I heard it gives you bad"
That was the end of my fianc??e.
"The more she put me down, the more I ate."
"Whenever somebody criticises me, I go right for those."
The best Weight Watchers meeting is on d Street.
Can't go near it cos there's a Krispy Kreme next door.
How many Weight Watchers points do you think is in one of those?
Would it be terrible if we split one?
Can I get a Krispy Kreme and a knife?
Whoever invented glaze is a genius.
"See, that is worth being fat for."
I know how we can burn this off.
Weight Watchers turned out to be a lot more enjoyable than Miranda expected.
I was all over his face.
I'd rather be good friends with myself.
I could get out with nothing more than a fine lip gloss.
You keep a box of tissues on the nightstand.
"While he's stroking you with one hand, he grabs a tissue and dabs his face."
Why didn't you just say something?
It's hard to criticise if you're with someone who overeats when criticised.
Miranda went out with an overeater and he overate her.
"When he popped his head up, he had such a proud look on his face."
"They always look proud, like they just came back from war."
They want that you're my hero kiss.
Not without a tissue and an Altoid.
I'd feel insulted if I'd gone down on a guy and he wouldn't kiss me.
"Samantha, do you kiss after a blow job?"
"No, she signs the delivery slip and sends him on his way."
Carrie has a problem that she saw me blowing the Worldwide Express guy.
That was her and not me.
When did I say I had a problem?
"You walked in, caught us and ran."
What was I supposed to do?
Where did you see her blowing him?
It was in the privacy of my office.
It wasn't a Worldwide Express guy.
It was my Worldwide Express guy.
We laugh about this kind of stuff all the time.
We'll be late for the stylist.
"I think it's a fantastic approach, and the publishers love the idea."
They wanted me buck naked waiting for the Mbus.
"Who is this stylist, Frederick's of Hollywood?"
Just go try at least one on.
I'm gonna look like an extra from Moulin Rouge .
The shoes are lined up in there.
Nothing in here I haven't seen and ruled out in junior high.
"Samantha This is my boyfriend, Marcus."
Papa's got himself a brand new bag.
I don't usually dress like a high class hooker.
That is not a hooker look.
What respectable New York woman would be caught dead wearing this?
We're having trouble deciding on my outfit.
"No, let's get a second, and I might add gay, opinion."
Doesn't she look adorable in that?
Isn't this the worst possible outfit for my cover?
Can you wait outside for a second?
"Samantha, I really appreciate the help."
You and I have different ideas about what's sexy.
"This is about the blow job, isn't it?"
One blow job and I'm a hooker with no taste.
This isn't about the blow job.
This is about the book cover.
I don't feel comfortable on a shelf next to a biography of Eleanor Roosevelt with my breasts hanging out.
I've seen you wearing not much else.
It's time for ladies my age to cover it up.
We can't get away with what we used to.
I saw that look in your eye in my office.
I thought we were having lunch.
Do you have no judgment about me and the Worldwide Express guy?
Will this relationship be priority overnight or next day delivery?
If I walked in on you giving a blow job to a Worldwide Express guy
You wouldn't because that is something I would never do.
I cannot believe you would judge me after everything we've been through.
I'm going to splash some water on my face and then I'm going home.
I will not be judged by you or society.
I will wear whatever and blow whomever I want as long as I can breathe and kneel.
"That night, Miranda had gone from facing her weight at Weight Watchers to waiting for her Weight Watcher's face."
Hey give me those gorgeous lips.
Doesn't that happen with other guys?
I'm a big fat sloppy eater?
I'm just worried I might be too many food points.
But not when I'm vulnerable and naked.
I'm not comfortable at this weight.
I don't think we should see each other any more.
I've got to concentrate on my diet.
I I was just being silly.
"The bad news was that from then on, Miranda had to go downtown to the notorious Weight Watchers next to the Krispy Kreme, where she wouldn't bump into Tom."
The good news was that she never wanted a glazed doughnut again.
That's all I get for a tailor made knock knock joke?
"So Two days, four calls, no answer."
Do we have to do this?
Can't we pretend the whole thing didn't happen?
If we don't want to talk on the phone again.
"In a few days, it will blow over."
That's an interesting choice of words.
I don't want to do the I'm sorry stuff with you.
"Sweetie, as lovely as that idea sounds, we're not perfect."
But I admire your ability to put your sex life out there.
So I brought some looks for my cover.
You were so good to me during the whole Big married man affair.
"Ever since Richard, I don't know who I am."
"Just like that, I realised what was under Samantha's fabulous cover."
I'm sorry about the delivery guy.
I had no idea what that must have been like for you.
Until I walked in on Stanford
getting a blow job from Marcus.
With a sexy pair of shoes Stanford was getting a blow job?
I thought he would be Never mind.
"Oh honey, we all thought that."
Sometimes it takes a friend to make a picture perfect.
"There is one day, even the most cynical New York woman dreams of all her life."
"White flowers, white tablecloths, white food."
W H I T E. White.
"She imagines what she'll wear, the photographers, the toasts."
Everybody's celebrating the fact that she finally found a publisher.
"This is a sexy event, so don't be afraid to use color."
"When your career is going better than ever, it's hard not to get a big head."
"Meanwhile, Miranda was back at the office and she was politically incorrectly happy to be there."
Miranda and Walker had shared one night of great sex B.C.
I'm so glad I wasn't waiting for your call.
I'm so glad you remember me.
I was hoping to take you on a very belated second date.
She invited him to be her plus one at the book party since she knew she'd be conveniently minus one.
Magda had already agreed to babysit.
"Meanwhile, Charlotte was working on her perfect plus one: Justin Anderson III."
"Thanks for another lovely lunch, and for walking me home."
Justin was just in time because Charlotte was finally ready for a new relationship.
And she's one of the friendly ones.
I think I'd better get back to work.
"I was in a new relationship, too, with my publisher."
I am so freaking excited about this party
"Seriously, Carrie, we are so golden."
People actually want to come to this book party.
"All of Cond Nast is coming, including GQ, which is actual straight men."
Someone better kiss me at this thing.
"So, it's not about selling books."
It's about finding you a boyfriend.
I didn't know you had somebody in here.
Would you like a Save the Date card?
Her book of essays comes out this week.
We published his first book last year.
What does that say about your publicity department?
Because she's not in my immediate family.
Jack wrote a hilarious comic novel that speaks to men the same way your column speaks to women.
Except men don't buy hilarious comic novels.
That's the flaw in the plan.
Sometimes it's cents on a card table on Sixth Avenue.
"You two should talk, because he knows the whole deal: The party, the signings, the reading, the tour."
"Minutes later, Jack Berger and I slowed down for a little fast food."
I'm not so much feeding them as I'm hitting them.
'Did the man have a little repressed anger?
'Or did he just dislike pigeons? '
The woman is tripping over the term repressed.
I'm just trying it on for size.
It's a little tight in the crotch.
I can't believe that you ordered strawberry.
Who orders strawberry after the age of
You have so much to learn about women.
That's what a few reviewers said.
How long do I have you for?
What else is on your agenda?
I gotta pick up some dry cleaning.
Would it be weird for you to come with me to pick it up?
It would be weird for you to send me.
We were having one of those great first dates you can only have when it's not an actual date.
I'm hoping to get a full deck.
And I didn't have a two of hearts.
We're on a last name basis now?
"Would you, by any chance, want to be my plus one on Thursday?"
"It's my book party, and I don't have a date... and you'll have the clean shirt and all."
"I would love that, but my girlfriend's parents are coming to visit, and they are staying with us."
It was like a bomb that just kept exploding: I have a girlfriend.
This whole flirtation's in your head.
He should have mentioned her earlier.
I hate it when men do that.
I just asked if that seat was taken.
"Thing is, I don't think he is."
I wonder how happy they are.
This is not a good side of me.
"Seriously, what's the point of meeting someone like that if they're not available?"
It's the universe telling you they're still out there.
Maybe the universe is telling you all the good ones are taken.
"I'm telling you, all the good ones are coming to the party."
"I can't remember, which is what happens when I really like someone."
Or he was a dating mirage.
"I was so hungry for a spark, I hallucinated a man."
You're the toast of the town.
"Finish your salad, and I'll treat you to a little mani pedi botox."
You say that like everybody does it.
I think I'd rather just crawl into bed.
"You have a fun, exciting, intellectually stimulating career, and there's about to be a huge soire thrown in your honor."
And I'll be without a plus one.
He should have said we something.
We go to this dry cleaners.
We might be breaking up soon.
I didn't tell Walker I had a baby.
How could you not mention it?
"If he'd asked me directly, Have you given birth recently?"
"I would have said, First of all, define 'recently. '"
I just don't want it to change everything.
"If I didn't have a baby, this is a guy I'd be dating."
"If Carrie's guy didn't have a girlfriend, then he's a guy she'd be dating, but he does."
Thanks for bringing that up again.
"In New York, they say you're always looking for a job, a boyfriend, or an apartment."
"So, let's say you have two out of three, and they're fabulous."
Why do we let the one thing we don't have affect how we feel about all the things we do have?
Why does one minus a plus one feel like it adds up to zero?
"Samantha didn't need a man to make her feel positive, but she did need a man to inject her forehead every so often."
We like to warn our patients that some people find it difficult to register emotion on their faces after the injections.
So you might have to say: I am so angry.
Miss Jones is familiar with the procedure.
"Like most high powered women, Samantha could handle the stress of her job, but not the stress lines."
"Before we do the botox, have you thought about a freshening chemical peel?"
"It takes minutes, and it can make you look to years younger."
"minutes later, Samantha seemed to have it all...peeled off."
There are times when a woman relishes being alone.
And those are the times you usually run into someone you don't wanna see.
"In my case, it was Enid, my editor at Vogue, also alone."
"No, I'm just grabbing a quick bite."
"So, do you really want company?"
I guess this way I can expense it.
Enid and I ran out of Vogue stuff to talk about midway through our salads.
Do you live in the neighborhood?
But the man I'm seeing does.
You have a wildly successful career and a relationship.
"I was worried we women, only get one or the other, but you have it all."
You gotta give me something here.
"To speak in magazine copy, yes, I have it all on the East Side."
He has someone else on the West Side.
"Luckily, the park provides a buffer."
I don't have time for a full time man.
I have a full time job.
That's the key to having it all.
Stop expecting it to look like what you thought it would look like.
"That's true of the fall lines, and it's true of relationships."
Her little tip earned Enid one invitation to my party.
"That night, Charlotte let her perfect plus one have it all."
She even let him stay the night in her perfect pre war apartment.
You're too good to be true.
"Unfortunately, Charlotte was about to get much more than she ordered."
"Bunny, what are you doing here?"
"The question is, what are you doing here?"
I'm hearing things from the co op board.
Mrs. Collier saw you kissing a male caller in the hall in the middle of the day.
I believe that kissing is allowed.
And Mrs. Pierce said a gentleman.
"We assume it was the same one, but who knows came home with you last night."
"And according to the doorman, he hasn't left yet."
What I do with my life in my apartment...
"And this apartment remains in the MacDougal name whereas you, Charlotte York, do not."
"So, you see, it's rather a sticky subject made stickier by the fact that you're still married."
Aren't you missing a pair of trousers?
"Don't you hustle me out, young lady."
"Charlotte discovered that a plus one, plus one ex mother in law equals disaster."
"Meanwhile, I was manning Party Central."
Anthony is going to be my date to the party.
What happened to this perfect plus one we all had to meet?
I don't wanna talk about it.
"Sweetie, what... That's my call waiting."
"I'm definitely on the list, correct?"
Of course you're on the list.
"Good, 'cause I'm bringing my boyfriend."
"I don't want to seem like a nobody, now that I have a somebody."
It's okay to be a nobody when you have nobody?
"Apparently, you're nobody till somebody loves you."
I can't believe I used to like that song.
It's the co dependent national anthem.
I just miss having you as my plus one.
The gay guy is the single gal's safety net.
"Even Charlotte has a gay plus one, and this is my big night."
Her little boy bitch Anthony is coming?
"'Cause he's bringing a woman, and I have it all."
"Honey, I've had a little something done and it's not as bad as yesterday, but I've looked better."
I'm not sure I should go to the party.
"Thanks to you, there's going to be people there."
I would like to see at least one familiar face.
I can't talk to the press.
And you said you'd be my plus one.
The party was one of those amazing events that would definitely end up on page
The fact that it was my party was just icing on the beautiful little cakes that were being passed around by beautiful little waiters.
Is it a bad thing if the party is better than the book?
"Not the straight men, of course."
Vanity Fair doesn't have a table.
I'm Harold Keenan of The New Yorker.
Harold Keenan from The New Yorker.
"This is Samantha Jones, bee keeper."
What are you doing under there?
"Hi, I've had a chemical peel."
"Could you at least separate the two thoughts, chemical peel, Carrie's publicist?"
I wanted to be super fresh for the party.
If you knew how many dinner parties I've sat through across from one of these.
And you were able to eat?
I'm entitled to a chemical peel.
"Women shouldn't have to hide in the shadows because they've had cosmetic surgery, which society nearly demands of them."
"This is my party, and you're scaring people."
And she's not afraid to say it.
"When I had my nose job, I stayed in for a month."
We have to go find Charlotte and her tiny little friend.
We were just getting to know each other.
I was planning on telling him.
"You can wrap it up in a Tiffany bow, but the point is you wanted to get laid first."
You tried to fix us up at the fashion show.
I didn't know he'd be here.
How long you two been going together?
"For some people, having it all is not enough."
They need someone who missed out on it all to be jealous.
We're getting a house in the Hamptons.
What do you do with the tails?
And he has a large penis
From a pair of queens to a hand still not shown...
Maybe you and I should go somewhere a little less crowded.
"Yes, but first I have to tell you something."
But I'm still allowed to have sex.
The guy's a friend who I accidentally slept with.
"Months from now, if we're still together, we'll figure this out."
"But for now, it's just us and I'm still the same person."
Let's go screw our brains out.
You sure we won't wake him?
"Miranda was trying to prove she could still do it all: Bring home the bacon, bring home the baby, and bring home an orgasm."
I don't think I can do this.
Couldn't I just please come first?
"Oh, so now you stop crying."
"The night of my big party, Miranda finally gave in to her little party, because she wasn't the same person."
"Actually, I think books are coming back."
You can quote me on the side of a bus if you want: Books are back.
Was that a yes or a no?
"As I looked around, I thought, Who needs a date?"
"I can have my cake and eat it, too."
"Then suddenly, there he was, looking cuter than I remembered and minus one girlfriend."
"So's the dessert tray, when it's your party."
"Just as a point of reference, my book party could have fit in the coat check of your party."
I thought you couldn't make it.
"I had to come by, say congratulations."
Good luck with the book and everything.
"He's obviously here because he felt something, too."
Can you call me from a cab and tell me that?
"I love you, but your face..."
The caterer just shooed me away from the buffet.
Do you mind if I go home?
"Honey, I wouldn't have gone out in public like this for anyone but you."
And I have to live with that.
My plus one dumped me for a shrimp waiter.
"I'd love to leave, but I have to stay."
I'm like the ice sculpture the party's supposed to happen around.
"I had to let him go, correct?"
I just wish he'd told me right up front.
"The thing is, there's some things people don't admit because they just don't like the way it sounds."
Don't tell me you invited Cliff.
Is this her side of town?
"East Side, West Side, who the hell knows down here?"
"As it turns out, even the most together woman can't keep it together when it comes to love..."
"Because just below the surface, we're all raw and exposed."
"So, what was the party for?"
I have a book coming out.
It's just a collection of my...
Why did I need a stranger to remind me of that?
"No, we have to celebrate this."
Gonna be in the bookstores and everything?
"If that's the case, then tonight, the hot dogs are on me."
"All I could think was, who needs a Berger when you can get a fabulous hot dog for cents or free?"
"Then again, maybe there is something to knowing they're out there."
"In the life of a New Yorker, there are several unpleasant things one will inevitably have to face: Having your purse stolen, random public urination, and seeing a gay friend's boyfriend in a Broadway revue."
I think I understand the three drink minimum now.
"Frankly, I'm more concerned about my own review in the Times."
"Oh, my God, right, your book's reviewed this week."
I thought you were suggesting an appetizer.
"She's brilliant, and she's really tough."
I think they're bringing us home.
How could you not love this?
I have to go to the ladies' room.
I have to go to the ladies' room.
"Who would have thought the phrase, Go see your cousin Debbie's club act could contain such horror?"
I thought there'd be at least one straight guy here.
"I mean, if not in the audience, then at least behind the bar."
"Hold on, 'cause Tomorrow, we're gonna cruise the cute pretzel guys at the Village Square Market."
Is that as sad as that just sounded?
"If it makes you feel any better, I had a thing for the Amish guys who make hairbrushes."
I recognized you from your column.
And I went out with Aidan right after you.
"There I was, worried about the New York Times when apparently I'd already been reviewed."
"I'm telling you, it was a hit and run."
"No, it was a face and run."
"I think you're being oversensitive, and it was a facial spasm or something."
"A lot of people have them, like Bell's palsy."
"No, it was not Bell's palsy."
"It was a full frontal attack of the face like: Wow, was he messed up."
You really screwed him up good.
What did you say to her?
I didn't have time to say anything.
She just ran out of the bathroom.
"Well, when you put it like that..."
Put me out of my misery.
"He's not hungry, he's not teething, he just wants to scream."
"I'm doing everything I can, but I can't please him."
If he was this is when we would break up.
"I'm telling you, this pound meatloaf is pushing me over the edge."
All of my clothes smell like barf.
"I don't have time to shower, much less get a haircut."
"That reminds me, I have to confirm my appointment with John Mandy at the John Mandy Salon."
You have no idea how hard it was to get this appointment.
I'm calling to confirm my appointment Saturday for a cut and color with John.
Time to go back to prison.
You don't have to do that.
"Actually, I have a few questions because I'm meeting with the divorce lawyer on Monday."
Ask him if I could get an injunction to stop a face.
But is he tough enough to beat Bunny to a pulp?
"Miranda, call me if you need anything."
Why is that girl still bothering me?
"Honey, you have to let it go."
"If I worried what every bitch in New York said about me, I'd never leave the house."
"Early Monday morning, Charlotte met with her lawyer."
"He was smart, tough, and gorgeous."
"You said you had some bad feelings about your mother in law, Bunny MacDougal."
I get a sense from her lawyer this is going to be a bit of a battle.
"It was a battle, all right."
The Charlotte who wanted to seem attractive to her adorable lawyer and the Charlotte who wanted to kick Bunny MacDougal's ass.
It looks to me that Mrs. MacDougal has been very busy hiding assets to make sure you don't get anything.
I just really want what was promised.
She was very careful to ensure your name was not on the deed.
"Usually, I'm a very refined person."
"With your husband out of the country, I'm gonna need you to be more specific."
Charlotte realized she could never be as ugly as she needed to be in front of a man she considered so handsome.
There's a bagel here with my name on it.
You're in the right hands here.
Who the hell ordered blueberry bagels?
I'm talking to Thelma about this.
"And just like that, Charlotte changed lawyers."
"After a grueling day, which included leg, eyebrow, and bikini waxes, Samantha decided to reward herself with a night of R and R. Unfortunately, her favorite vibrator needed a little CPR."
You gotta stop that baby from crying.
"I said I was sorry, but I have a baby and sometimes babies make noise."
"And if you ever bothered to say hello in the elevator, you'd know that."
"I'm Kendall, my baby is Alika."
"Evidently, Miranda had been getting bad reviews from inside her own building."
"As for my review, I guess I was pretty nervous."
I hadn't been up this early since Princess Diana's wedding.
"All in all, I enjoyed spending time in Ms. Bradshaw's sharp, funny, finely drawn world where single women rule, and the men are disposable."
I believe what you have there is a rave review from the New York Times.
"I don't dispose of men, do I?"
"Michiko Kakutani thinks so, and I always agree with her."
"Actually, it was a good night."
I can't believe I have to go and pretend to be a lawyer now.
Can I wear a baseball cap to work?
"My God, listen to me going on and on about Michiko Kakutani when you have real problems."
So can I obsess for another minute?
Just don't say her name again.
It'll push me over the edge.
"So, yes, some of the men in the book are maybe a little disposable, but this makes it sound like I think men are disposable in life."
I fell asleep for a second.
That's a terrible thing to think about me.
"Oh, my God, that's what the face meant."
Do you think that Aidan thinks that I think he was disposable?
"Carrie, you did not throw Aidan away."
He must have said something like that to her.
Where else would she get it?
Has Steve ever said anything to you?
Then how come I never see him anymore?
You never see him because I have to keep him away.
"Because if I see him now, I'll ask him to marry me just to give me some help."
I worked very hard at taking care of Aidan's feelings.
Will you mention that to Steve?
Maybe you should call your girlfriend Samantha.
She has all kinds of time to talk about this kind of stuff.
"I know it's me and I'm jealous of her free time and all, but if she could maybe just once acknowledge the fact that I've had a baby..."
It's not enough I've alienated my neighbor.
Tell that to D. She's pissed off I don't know her name.
Do you know your neighbors' names?
I'm a bad neighbor and a bad mother.
You're just having a bad week.
Can I do anything to help?
"Why is it that we only seem to believe the negative things people say about us, no matter how much evidence there is to the contrary?"
"A neighbor, a face, an ex boyfriend can cancel out everything we thought was once true."
"Odd, but when it comes to life and love, why do we believe our worst reviews?"
"After a long day in court, Miranda faced another jury."
"And at City Bakery, Samantha and I were reviewing the desserts."
I'll buy you dessert if you do something for me.
I'm not eating desserts this week.
"Come on, best brownies in New York."
What do you need me to do?
It's about Miranda and the baby.
"And from what I've heard, this one sounds like an asshole."
You can't call a baby an asshole.
I don't think it would kill all of us to be a little more supportive.
"When he's in college, I'll take him for a drink and flirt with his friends."
Maybe you could just stop by Tomorrow and say: I hear you had a baby.
"I have my hair appointment, and I'm returning a vibrator before that."
"Yes, that is my life, and I don't have to justify it."
I hate it when people have babies and they suddenly expect you turn into a Norman Rockwell painting.
"We're not talking about people, we're talking about our friend."
She gets to run in and out once a month while I'm chained to the hem of Anna Wintour.
"There I was, face to face with the face girl."
How do you two know each other?
"Hi, nice to see you again."
How do you know Nina Katz?
How do you know Nina Katz?
She's the booker for Saturday Night Live.
That face will be all over Vogue.
I'm going to need a big brownie as well.
"The next day, Samantha did some personal shopping."
"Yes, I'd like to return this vibrator."
I bought it here six months ago.
You expect me to believe that women buy these to help their sore necks?
I'd like to return this neck massager.
It failed to get me off.
"It has a warranty, and it just stopped."
"Honey, it wouldn't be the first one."
"Just find another, and go to the cashier."
I know a man who's in desperate need of a neck massage.
That one actually works against you.
"If we wanted to work that hard, we'd get us a man."
Samantha instantly established herself as the Michiko Kakutani of vibrators.
I think that one actually is a back massager.
That will burn your clit off.
What have you got to say that is so important?
"Now, this chair is a little controversial, but I don't give a shit."
'Cause it stopped my baby from crying when I was about ready to throw myself off the fire escape.
Alika could sit in it for hours.
How come you haven't heard about this?
"If they don't have kids, they don't have a clue."
"Miranda, you're not a bad mother."
You just didn't have the chair.
You have a appointment with John Mandy at the John Mandy Salon.
"I'm counting to five, then I'm changing my mind."
I don't know what to say.
"Neither can I, but here I am, Mary fucking Poppins."
"The numbers are on the fridge, and don't take him out of that chair."
It's the only thing that keeps him quiet.
"Meanwhile, in a chair across town, I was enjoying an afternoon of absolutely nothing."
Do you think Nina Katz is telling random celebrity hosts that I'm the bad breakup girlfriend?
You said she loved to talk.
"Do you think she's trashing me to, say, a Gwyneth Paltrow or an lan McKellen?"
I don't flatter myself that a Gwyneth Paltrow or an lan McKellen would be interested in my love life.
"No, thanks to you, I am at Miranda's and Brady won't stop screaming, and I don't know what to do."
I sent her to get my haircut.
"Yes, and now I'm being punished."
Then I don't know what his problem is.
His problem is he's an asshole.
It took me months to get that appointment.
I'll find some way to keep this kid quiet.
Maybe Charlotte has the time to talk about this kind of stuff.
I have a screaming baby on my hands.
"I mean, did he... That better be brand new."
"Monday morning, Harry did his best to make sure Bunny didn't hop all over Charlotte."
Mrs. MacDougal is willing to offer her son's collection of mint condition silver Buffalo coins.
Could we get off the coin collection?
She's not going to settle for coin collection.
"Bunny, if you have something to say to me..."
"You, my dear, took a vow."
"And when things didn't go your way, you simply broke that vow."
I come from a generation of women that valued marriage.
We believed in for better or for worse.
"Not for better, or until the road gets rocky."
When I think of the heartache and shame you caused my dear boy...
I'm amazed that you could even come here and look me in the face.
It seemed to her she'd been fighting for this marriage forever.
"Be advised, young lady, I'm more than prepared to go to court."
"Apparently, our office received a telegram from Scotland from Dr. MacDougal."
Charlotte York was a wonderful wife.
"Sometimes, when you least expect it, you get a rave."
"I'll have papers drawn up, so Mrs. MacDougal can transfer the deed."
"Even though things had gotten ugly, Charlotte didn't want them to end that way."
I'm sorry things didn't work out better for all of us.
Charlotte realized there was no such thing as a fairy tale divorce either.
"Ding dong, the witch is dead."
"And farther uptown, still unable to let it go, Nina Katz and that face had driven me to face my worst fear."
"So, Steve, I know I was kind of vague on the phone..."
She doesn't want me to call her so much.
It's about... How does Aidan feel about me?
"You're not going to try to get back together with him again, are you?"
"No, but that pretty much answers any question I had about how you feel."
"So, what, does he hate me?"
"No, but come on, Carrie, it was pretty bad."
"But back then, he couldn't get out of bed for like..."
I don't mean to make you feel bad.
He lost his ability to open up and trust women.
He lost his ability to open up and trust women?
"No, guys don't talk about shit like that."
"But the girl, Nina, he was dating, she told me that."
"Okay, we're looking for the cute pretzel guys."
How come you never wanted to cruise guys when I was available?
"This isn't about cruising, it's about clarity."
That face chick is hitting a little too close to home.
I want to find her and tell her my side of the breakup story.
You know what you and Aidan had.
"I know it, but she doesn't.And she's yip yapping her version all over town."
It only takes one bad review to cancel out all the good word of mouth.
What do you think of Marcus?
You can't reduce them to a face.
I know that Aidan has feelings...
"I've listened to you talk about Aidan, for what...ten blocks, and two years?"
And I've been a wonderful audience.
"And I ask you about my Marcus, and all I get is nice ?"
How many relationships have I been in since you've known me?
"Come on, your opinion means a lot to me."
"So, now what, you want me to review your relationship?"
"Okay, well, I like that he makes you happy."
"okay, one more time, and you are officially stalking me."
"I need to talk to you for a second, alone, if I can."
"Miss Graham, may I buy you a pretzel?"
"I get the sense that you have a sort of feeling about what happened with Aidan, and I just want to clear something up."
"Breakups are awful, and they are private."
And they are not necessarily sympTomatic of what two people had together.
"And I would never, ever have done anything to deliberately hurt him."
"Suddenly, I realized the critic I was most afraid of wasn't Nina Katz."
"The truth is, at any given moment, someone, somewhere could be making a face about you."
But it's the reviews you give yourself that matter.
"...with Heather Graham and I'm like, Shit, what do we have to talk about?"
But we had nothing to talk about but pretzels.
"I said, Have you ever been to Bavaria?"
They make the best pretzels there.
"One night, four ladies in the east met at Compass to discuss going west."
I have to go to San Francisco on a book tour.
You wouldn't go to the Upper West Side.
"Suddenly, you're going to San Francisco?"
"Apparently, I'm very big in San Francisco."
"You mean, Big is in San Francisco."
"Okay, yes, perhaps I'll see Big."
"Guys, I need to have sex."
"Lately, I've been having these dreams where I run."
I run up to complete strangers and just start kissing them.
No need to go across the country for sex.
Those guys have been checking us out ever since they sat down.
"Scallops are scallops, and bachelors are bachelors."
"Sounds to me like you might be experiencing a been there, done them existential crisis."
"It's not me, it's New York."
"In fact, they should change the name to Same York."
"These scallops are fantastic, and those guys are cute."
"No, I don't want to say hi."
I want to say: Could one of you lie on top of me for a while?
I need to feel the weight of a man on me.
"At times like this, I wish women could go to male prostitutes."
"No, only in bad screenplays and first novels."
That is an incredible investment idea.
"We should open a brothel where the men are cute, and the sheets are count Egyptian cotton."
"Samantha, you can be the madam."
"We could put one in every neighborhood, like Starbucks."
Such a place doesn't exist in reality because women don't think about sex like that.
"No, Big is my male prostitute."
I am mixing business with much needed pleasure.
And my relief is just a train ride away.
I get uneasy seeing the National Guard go through my makeup case.
Especially if Samantha goes with me.
"Please, come on, it'll be hilarious."
And the whole trip ends with a luxury suite in a fabulous four star San Francisco hotel.
Because Samantha is the only one who's bored enough to do it.
So what time do we leave Same York ?
More and more single women of a certain age are looking for a certain thing.
And that certain thing does not necessarily involve a certain ring.
"We may have traded the little black book for a little black dress, and replaced the Ferrari with a Fendi."
"But in view of certain evidence, I had to wonder: Are we the new bachelors?"
What did Big say when you told him?
I'm gonna wait till I get there.
"You know, Hello, guess where I am."
"I would have called and said: I'm coming, and I won't be the only one."
I think I'm getting a pimple.
"Good, the last thing I need is a big, honking zit when I meet my prostitute."
"This may be just what I needed, if I can stand the train for three days."
Think of it as an adventure.
"It's not the destination, it's the journey."
"A journey in adjoining, first class, deluxe sleeper berths."
"Truth be told, I've always wanted to take a train."
You never know who's going to be getting on and getting me off.
"We were supposed to have the deluxe, first class sleeper."
This is the first class sleeper.
And I suppose the regular class sleeps in what?
"Right here, you have your door to the restroom."
I'm starting to understand why there was a murder on the Orient Express.
And in a far less crowded space...
I thought they'd send a messenger.
Do you know what we'd charge you for a messenger to make a block drop?
"So, a partner personally delivers my divorce papers?"
"I was just gonna go work out, but come in."
I'm schvitzing like a pudding at a picnic.
This is the pagoda we've been fighting over.
I can see why you'd never want to give it up.
After what we went through to get it?
It's too big for one person.
If anyone knows a great apartment...
I got a buddy who has a place.
It may be a little too bachelor for your taste.
You should've seen this place earlier.
It was where plaid furniture came to die.
I could set it up so you can get a first look.
Do you have a handkerchief or something?
You are no longer Mrs. Trey MacDougal.
You have some tissue stuck to you.
"Somewhere outside of Pittsburgh, Samantha and I decided to get out of our twin cans and go for a classic train dinner in the club car."
I thought there'd be white linen tablecloths and Bing Crosby singing at a piano.
"Excuse me, table for two, please."
"Are you aware, every time we stop, good looking people get off and more ugly people get on?"
"I'm serious, this is the train to ugly."
There isn't one man on this train I'd fuck.
And nine hours of train rocking hasn't helped.
"If she has a problem, next time she can take a buggy."
How would the Zagat Guide rate a place that lists potato chips as an appetizer?
Don't even say potato chip to me.
This zit is getting bigger by the hour.
Let's just say you're starting to look like you belong on a train.
"God, I need a big old drink."
I told you he was a bachelor.
But a bar in the bedroom?
You seem to know your way around here.
I sublet while I was going through my divorce.
I can't believe that men think it takes all this stuff to get a woman into bed.
I think you are the sexiest woman I ever met.
"Harry, don't be ridiculous, I'm wearing my glasses."
It makes me crazy when you say my name.
Then I'm definitely gonna stop saying it.
What a putz your ex husband must be.
"If I was lucky enough to have you in my bed, I would never take my hands off you."
"Ever since the first moment I saw you, I can't think about anything else."
"I fantasize about your lips, your perfect pink lips."
"Two days, two toilet showers, and too many club sandwiches later..."
"It's me, and it's still bad."
I tried to squeeze it somewhere outside Oklahoma.
Here's a helpful hint: Never give yourself a train facial.
"If this thing doesn't deflate by Colorado, I'm not even calling Big."
"Hold on, someone who used to be Samantha just came in."
"Rumor has it a group of guys not resembling the Elephant Man just got on, and are having a bachelor party in the bar car."
I can't go anywhere with this pimple.
I got on a train for you.
You are going to the bar car with me.
I have to go to a bachelor party.
"And back in New York, Charlotte found herself sandwiched between some confirmed bachelors."
How can a person have really hot S E X with someone they don't even like?
You're spelling sex in a place with a go go boy on the bar?
Some of the best sex I've had is with people I can't stand.
He was showing me this bachelor apartment.
I think it was all the leather and music.
"Suddenly, out of nowhere, we were kissing and then we..."
I don't want to date him.
"No, I could never date him."
But maybe just for the sex.
You have to be very clear about the rules.
You can't act romantic at all.
You have to talk just sex talk.
This blush is worse than a pimple.
I look like I'm in a high school play or something.
Aren't you boys a sight for sore eyes?
We can do better than that.
"Sir, a bottle of champagne, please."
I'm sure one of you gentlemen will help me pop my cork.
"And just like that, we went from Some Like It Hot to Some Like Us Not."
I thought I was looking pretty hot.
"Excuse me, but what kind of bachelor party is this?"
"Except Bri, he's the last one in the gang to bite it."
"Yeah, we're taking him to the Giants game in San Francisco."
My friend over there has come on this very long trip as a favor to me and I was hoping that one of you fellows could oblige her in a little harmless male flirtation.
"As far as a pimp, I was a total train wreck."
"It's not New York that's the problem, it's me."
"I am having an...The midlife thing, you know."
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"I mean, I already fuck younger guys and I don't want a sports car."
"Oh, God, parking in New York is a bitch."
All because I had to get laid.
Let's get another bottle to celebrate.
"One very long trip later, Samantha and I dragged our cabooses into a bookstore near the Golden Gate."
I guess you are big in San Francisco.
You made it in one piece.
All these people came to hear me read?
They're not all just for you.
He's making an appearance right after you.
"They had a chance to get Mr. Winkle, and they jumped at it."
"Lily, I can't be the opening act for a dog."
The West Coast sales rep totally fucked me on this.
"One sec, I'll be right back."
"Thanks, but don't even waste your energy."
"You know, go back to the hotel, and get in that giant tub and relax."
"I'll see you later, we'll have a meal."
Aren't you going to call Big?
"Between the pimple and the puppy, I'm not up for it."
This book tour stuff is rough.
"As I walked home, I couldn't help but wonder: Was it Big, was it New York or was it me?"
When is Mr. Winkle coming out?
"So, if there are no other questions about my book...Yes, I see a hand, but I can't see the man."
"This Big character, does he have a real name?"
"Yes, but I can't reveal it."
I have to protect his privacy.
I no longer cared about Mr. Winkle.
"Big's here, I need to have sex."
I got you a smaller room all to yourself downstairs.
I can't get in another small room.
I'm not gonna go through this again in another six months.
I told him to come up in about half an hour.
"So, did you hide the body?"
Or whatever it was you had to do that kept me wandering around the hotel gift shop for half an hour.
This will set your publisher back.
"Here, let me kiss it and make it all better."
I promised my partners I'd make a vineyard connection with the restaurant owner.
We'll have a nice meal and catch up.
"So, I'm walking through the mall, and I see your book."
"Wait, you were in a mall?"
You've gotta go through them to get to the outside.
"Anyway, I pass a bookstore, and there you are, right in the window next to the real books."
"I bought it, drove right home, sat on my porch, lit up a cigar, and I read it cover to cover."
I had no idea that I hurt you so much.
"I gotta say, it was tough to see it in print."
"Not all at one sitting, one reading, one right after the other."
I really got how much I hurt you.
"No, some of that stuff really happened."
Let's forget all that and talk about something else.
You know that chapter about my apartment key?
Was I really that big of an asshole?
"He was like the city itself, cold, infuriating and exhausting."
"Suddenly, it became clear to me: This was not my best laid plan."
"See, that's what I'm talking about."
When have I ever been cold?
I just don't want you to get hurt again.
"According to this book, it is not just sex."
What happened in New York was all my fault.
"You were unavailable, and very clear about that."
Or at least lie on top of me.
"Carrie, I think it's very clear from this book that when it comes to me, you do not have good judgment."
And it's not even a bestseller.
I can't believe this is happening.
Are you involved with someone else?
I just don't want to do something here that I'll be sorry for later.
Put the book down and look at me.
Let's talk just a little more.
I love making love to you.
And you... have a hard dick.
"Now, put your pants on and go."
There they were: The bachelorette and the beast.
"Good morning, it's your wake up call."
"After my wake up call, I got my real wake up call."
"Thanks to my book, nothing was ever going to happen with Big."
"I have two book readings this morning, before I head back to New York."
You'll need material for the sequel.
Like that freckle on my face that he once told me he loved.
"I could do my best to cover it during the day, but at night, after I washed the city off my face, there it was, a tiny brown dot near the tip of my lip."
And I wondered how something so small could suddenly seem so big.
"So, how did it go with Big?"
"Yeah, but it was not as simple as I had hoped."
The question and answer section of this reading is now over.
I'll tell you on the train.
"American Airlines, first class, and some Valium."
I cannot wait to get to New York.
And sometimes it's not the journey.
"In this ever expanding galaxy called New York City, there are certain heavenly bodies one orbits around every day."
And then there are those stars whose gravitational pull one drifts in and out of over the years.
"Bobby Fine, satellite friend, piano bar legend."
I usually do this number at home in a pink caftan and a Peggy Lee wig.
Like you've never done the same thing after three daiquiris?
"But right now, I must take a quick break to say hello to a celebrity friend."
"Okay, one more time for the cheap seats in the back."
How long have you two known each other?
"It hasn't been that long, has it?"
"Please, darling, when we met, you took aerobics and Stanford had hair."
I thought you had a dinner.
"The driver is circling, but I had to run up and say hello."
"This is Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and the one who liked Cats."
I did PR for your museum benefit.
"Samantha, of course, I loved you."
I was just so thrilled that someone actually liked Cats.
I didn't like it that much.
I'm madly in love and getting married.
I finally found the right girl.
Mr. Broadway has to go tinkle before he can tinkle.
"Yeah, Mr. Broadway has to go tinkle ?"
That's the gayest sentence ever uttered.
He must be marrying her for the money.
He was one of the original investors in Chorus Line.
Just when you thought you'd never hear anything gayer than Mr. Broadway has to go tinkle.
Why would he be getting married?
In Bobby Fine announced that he was going to sell his piano bar downtown and go volunteer with Nicaraguan orphans.
So the really big question is where are we going to stay?
"What about, Why are these two people marrying each other?"
Bitsy said they were madly in love.
"You see, I find the love facade the most offensive part."
"Bitsy should say, I'm getting older, and I want companionship."
"Or Bobby should say, The hot men don't go for me anymore."
But don't print invitations and call it love as if love transforms people and changes molecules 'cause that's bullshit.
I guess you don't want to be my date then.
"No dates, unless they have summer houses."
We can stay with Stanford and Marcus.
I was a fool to break up with Richard before Labor Day.
I wouldn't go to this charade if you paid me.
It's like there's a pink suede elephant in the middle of the room and nobody's allowed to talk about it.
You think they won't have sex?
All married couples stop having sex eventually.
You've had sex with lots of married people.
How do you sustain a relationship without the zsa zsa zsu?
"That butterflies in your sTomach thing that happens when you not only love the person, but you gotta have them."
Isn't that what gets you through the years?
"Even if it fades, at least you have the memory of the zsa zsa zsu."
I'm fine with whatever people want to do.
I think that's how Bitsy proposed to Bobby.
It was right about then Charlotte decided to be straight with us.
You're in a sort of relationship?
"But he's bald and short, and he talks with his mouth full."
I don't even want to be seen in public with him.
"I hate his name, Harry, because he is, everywhere but his head."
It's the best sex of my life.
I think I might really like him.
You want to go to a wedding in the Hamptons in a few weeks?
"Oh, yeah, I handled her divorce."
I just never thought of you as a Hamptons type.
I own a house in Bridge.
I'm not really ready for swimsuit season.
You're not supposed to be able to grab someone's back.
This is how I was born.
What am I supposed to do about it?
"You come with me to the wedding, and I will get my back waxed."
"That night, I thought about what it takes to make a relationship work till death do us part."
Most singles have more long term success with friends.
So maybe it is a better strategy to marry a friend.
"However, in the absence of sex, whether that's the arrangement, or just what happens after a few years, what distinguishes this companion from your many other companions?"
"When it comes to saying I do , is a relationship a relationship without the zsa zsa zsu?"
"Or in Samantha's case, how much is a woman due for surviving the zsa zsa zsu?"
Our pathetic relationship is as close to marriage as either one of us ever hopes to get.
So I feel I deserve some sort of settlement.
"Like, say, a weekend at your house in the Hamptons."
You're not invited to that either.
"A couple of weeks later, another couple of exes were working out their summer share."
Me and Brady were just napping.
They look down on napping at work.
I was going to give him one more bottle before I left.
"I know, but I like it."
It used to be all breasts.
"Miranda wasn't sure if it was the smell of the lilacs, the smell of the baby, or the smell of Steve's skin."
"But that afternoon, Steve went from ex to sex."
"Miranda admitted they were somewhere between friends and lovers, somewhere between Manhattan and the Hamptons."
That's why you decided to participate in the charade.
Perhaps it was the zsa zsa zsu.
"It was an itch which we shouldn't have scratched, because now we're into a gray area."
Not having sex was the only thing holding us together.
You're fleeing to the right wedding.
"You can't have a kid with someone, and get along and have great sex without giving the wrong impression."
"That being what, that you're happy?"
"I look forward to seeing you, too."
This party is going to be amazing.
But shitty pants there is not.
I wouldn t be able to find a sitter.
"Evidently, there's already a party pooper."
"What's going on here, are you okay?"
Do I need to make a tourniquet out of a hotdog bun and a twig?
I didn't figure you for a motorcycle guy.
I bought it as a reaction to my breakup.
It was exactly what I wanted.
A Berger with a side of single.
I look good next to it.
"On it, I look like this."
"I pulled over because you know, a bug hit my visor, and my hands are still shaking."
"Well, if you make it to the Hamptons, my friend is having a party Tomorrow afternoon."
I pass it on the way to my house.
I'm going to get a soda.
My throat's kind of dry from all the screaming inside my helmet.
"If you don't, call the Highway Patrol."
"The next morning, Samantha prepared her borrowed beach house for the big bash."
I want half the tables set up near the house and the others near the pool.
"Cassandra, did you bring my tote?"
The wait staff is to change in the guest cottage down near the entrance.
I've got the house this weekend.
Richard told us we could hang by the pool whenever.
I have no cell reception at all.
"I know you didn't want babies, but he's in Ralph Lauren and I stuck a cork up his ass, so it'll be okay."
This is supposed to be an A list party.
Then who's the Double D list by the pool?
They say Richard lets them hang out here on weekends.
I went through a lot with Richard.
And people should be rewarded for not getting married as well.
"Frankly, I don't know why you broke up with him."
What's a little lying and cheating compared to a pool with a little cabana?
"Did you say no babies, or no boobies ?"
"What, like everyone here can't see those tits are fake?"
Everyone can see those tits are fake.
Would you stop saying tits ?
Why are you wearing that shirt?
You must've had a bad reaction to the waxing.
"Yeah, I thought it felt a little itchy."
Suddenly a little hair isn't looking so bad?
"Carrie, woman to woman, the sex is amazing."
I've never had a man make me feel this way.
"Hush, Miss Scarlett, how you do go on."
"Bobby, Bitsy, this is my boyfriend, Marcus."
"For God's sake, man, get yourself to a gym once in a while."
I could grate cheese on your abs.
"One large pizza, and hold the salami."
"Please, put a shirt on before I marry you."
I haven't touched a carbohydrate in three months.
I've got to fit into that dress.
"I swear, and I'm totally serious, I almost fainted when he mimed grated cheese on Marcus."
It is so obvious that he wanted him.
Maybe he just makes her laugh.
Can't you wait till we sit down to eat?
Is there anything about me today that doesn't bug you?
You should have your shirt on.
And you have sauce on your face.
Why did she need to tell me the sex was amazing?
She's amazed he's able to get hard without another penis in the room.
"And speaking of dicks, do you think Richard slept with any of those cocoa butter bitches?"
I'm sure they're just good friends.
How long have you had a house here?
"Moments later, among the butterflies, I felt butterflies."
"I have been known to hoe, but my ex actually planted the garden so we could enjoy fresh summer salads."
We didn't quite make it to the summer.
So it's more fresh pain than fresh vegetables.
I can't really go out there.
When I broke up with my ex.
I couldn't bring myself to go within six blocks of his furniture store.
When did you two break up?
"Last year, for the second time."
We broke up the first time the year before that.
"Yeah, well, we hadn't sufficiently hurt each other enough the first time round."
But we definitely took care of business this time.
"Because this time, he moved in, so we had the merging of the things..."
"...the dividing of the things, the things that are left behind that you don't want to get back because that seems mean, and you don't want to throw them away because it's all you have left."
It gets harder as we get older because we're not dating wildly inappropriate people anymore.
"You know, there's no Glad that's over."
After every breakup I tell myself I'm not doing this again.
"I mean, how many of these things can one person survive?"
"You know, they should institute a helmet law for relationships."
"It's going to take me six hours to drive the two miles home, so...My jacket."
I hope there aren't grass stains.
The man could not get away from me fast enough.
"Apparently, it's a short road from commisery to misery."
Everything's going out right on time.
What are you doing in my refrigerator?
Did you see any Rice Krispie treats?
Richard usually leaves those around for us.
And those lemons are for the drinks.
And I also paid for the food.
"In fact, The only thing at this party that you two actually paid for are your breasts"
I'm just dying to look like this.
"Maybe if you did, you'd be out here with Richard."
"Evidently, people who borrow glass houses shouldn't throw cantaloupes."
"The next morning, while Stanford and Marcus had Brady, Miranda and I had brunch."
How about we marry gay guys?
How about maybe now I won't have a choice?
"One minute we were laughing, the next minute he had to get away from me so fast, he left skidmarks."
I can show them to you.
"I revealed too much, too soon."
It was the zsa zsa zsu.
Bitsy Von Muffling Fine may have the right idea.
Maybe we should stop looking for a great relationship and settle for a fine one.
I'd marry Steve in a second if he were gay.
"So, a gay area is better than a gray area?"
Tell me something I don't know.
"Great man, great house, great relationship."
"We've all been looking, and you actually found it."
Marcus and I haven't had sex since we bought the Cynthia Rowley china.
"Bitsy Von Muffling, the first time I saw you, I fell in love."
You walked in wearing that red vintage Dior.
I am listening to the bride and bride.
Something tells me Bitsy isn't doing Fine.
And that's the little piece of information she's been Von Muffling.
"You are there for me in the morning, and there for me at night, there in the good, there in the bad, there in my thoughts, there in my dreams, but most of all, my darling, you are there in my heart forever."
Perhaps we were all much too cynical.
"Perhaps, somehow, despite the odds, Bobby and Bitsy had found something real."
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
"One more time, for the cheap seats at the back."
Looks like somebody over here is about to dance.
I think you may have sold this one a little short.
"With a little time and the right astringents, who knows?"
"There's nothing on my face, nothing in my teeth."
I'm sure you'll hate my moves on the dance floor but that is the risk that every man must take.
It's too bad I blew my only chance at a boyfriend this year.
You want to hold my boyfriend?
I think I'm going to drown my sorrows in another piece of cake.
"And if anybody asks, I had two, not three."
Should we call Daddy and tell him we miss him?
Funny where life has taken us.
I remember when we went to these things just for the free food.
I have dinner rolls in my purse.
"And there's my girl, whom I love."
In case you had any money riding on it.
"Look out, she's got a piece of fruit, and she's not afraid to throw it."
Can we not talk about that?
But we'll be the only ones here.
"Look, I'm just glad Brady wasn't the biggest baby at the party."
"I guess I went a little crazy, being at Richard's house around his party crashing pussy posse."
What do you call zsa zsa zsu gone bad?
Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world
The top layer of the crme brule just wasn't hard enough.
"Yeah, that's the problem with this wedding."
The crme brule isn't hard enough.
"And then one day, he went away, and I thought I would die."
"And when I didn't, I said to myself, is all that there is to life?"
I was having lunch in town today and for some reason the groom invited me.
Now you want me to wax my eyebrows?
I think I may be falling in love with you.
I've been falling for you since the moment we met.
"Come on, you could have any blue blooded guy here."
I have to marry a Jew.
"She can marry a gay guy, and you can't marry an Episcopalian?"
"Apparently, Charlotte had a zsa zsa Jew."
And I intend to stay that way.
I just wasn't sure if I was up for all that again.
Maybe we should go out on a date before we break up.
"When it comes to relationships, maybe we're all in glass houses and shouldn't throw stones."
Because you can never really know.
And some people refuse to settle for anything less...than butterflies.
When you live in the city that never sleeps it comes as a bit of a shock when somehow you manage to oversleep.
"Sir, I have to be downtown in minutes."
I thought that you need a lift.
Which way to the stock exchange?
I'm here to ring the bell.
"All right, you have to put this on."
"Today, one of New York's favorite newspapers the New York Star is going public."
And here to open trading is one of its favorite columnists Carrie Bradshaw.
The day after the stock market I met the ladies for lunch in the fashionable Meat Market.
It almost made me want to invest in something.
"A room full of screaming, sweating men all trying to get it up."
I like my money right where I can see it.
I bought shares of your newspaper yesterday.
When I moved to this neighborhood the only thing that cost was a hand job from a tranny.
I mean no smoking in bars.
"Well, first there would have to be a no fucking section."
"I mean, just look at this street."
The only designer name that belongs in the Meatpacking District is Oscar Mayer.
But that's what's great about New York.
There's always a new neighborhood or restaurant
"Friday night, my first official date with Jack."
It's all fun and games till someone has a child.
"So, what do you two have planned?"
So many outfits need to be scouted.
You kids today and your dating.
I feel like a girl of again.
Then you better find out his bottom line right up front.
If Harry had told me he could only be serious about me if I were Jewish I doubt I'd be in my situation.
What kind of man passes up pussy for Purim?
Soup and a tenderloin of pork.
"You can order pork, but you can't get serious about our future because I'm not Jewish."
And from the meat market to the marriage market.
"Charlotte, it doesn't work that way."
My conservative doesn't have anything to do with wearing pearls.
"Look, I know what you're thinking, okay?"
Why did I let things get this far without talking about this?
Why did I sleep with you or even kiss you?
Because I couldn't not kiss you.
"Not sleep with you, not see you."
"Believe me, I never thought a shiksa goddess like you would fall for a putz like me."
Do you even know what putz means?
You got a little doody on your forehead.
I did not say it like that.
Let's see how you like it.
"Brady, tell Mommy to stop chasing Daddy."
You weren't the one with shit on your face.
I don't have time for this.
I have to get up early.
I don't know why you're here.
You dropped off the baby hours ago.
I don't have time to stand around while you read the paper and order food in Don't you have a life?
"Oh, my God, I can't believe it."
"Come on, are you seriously telling me you didn't know?"
I just can't believe you admitted it.
Did you not hear me just say I was in love with Steve?
I think I got an old bottle of Kahl??a somewhere.
I think I got an old bottle of Kahl??a somewhere.
"Last night, we were in the dining room, and we were laughing."
"All of a sudden, I looked over at him and I realized we belong together."
So I picked a fight and threw him out of my apartment.
These Triscuits have been here since the mid '.
I so cannot be in love with Steve.
Steve so is not the guy for me.
Steve so is the guy for me.
"No, I was just asking if Brady can eat crackers yet."
How can I have been wrong all these years?
It just took you a while to get here.
I have a lot invested in this relationship.
Plus you said you were in love with him.
So how are you gonna tell him?
Maybe I should take him somewhere romantic where I can't start a fight.
Do you know what this means?
You're asking Steve out on a date.
"That night, as Samantha walked home past her friendly neighborhood bar, the Rampole she saw something truly upsetting."
Just what we need: Another Wall Street asshole with money.
"And uptown, in a slightly less obvious maneuver"
Is this whole Jewish thing really that big a deal?
"The next morning, bright and early"
"It's a beautiful morning, and the sun is shining."
And you changed your mind about the Jewish thing.
I asked you if it was that important to you and you said no.
"When we were making love, right before you came."
"Charlotte, honey, I can't remember my own name right before I come."
Asking me to renounce Judaism during sex is a clear manipulation.
Why is it so important to you?
I promised my mother I would marry a Jew.
Charlotte had had her fill of potential husbands and their demanding mothers.
Harry's stock suddenly began to plummet.
"And just like that, it was up again."
I'm very sorry your mother is no longer with us because if she met me
She'd fall in love with you like I did and not care?
Keeping tradition alive was very important to her.
She lost family in the Holocaust.
Now I can't say anything because you've brought up the Holocaust.
I wanted to clear that up.
"So, you're probably standing there screening."
I'm a big fan of the screen.
"In fact, don't pick up or I'll just I'll panic and hang up."
I'm not ready for actual voice on voice action.
So I'm jumping right in and suggesting dinner and a movie for the big date.
"Everybody's really been loving that movie, Craig's Room."
Why don't we go and hate it?
"And he calculated which times and which theaters would be least crowded, which says, take charge."
"Yet left the restaurant choice to me, which says, flexible."
"All in all, the perfect machine message."
I think Berger and I are going to be very happy together.
I love this time before the first date when you can say things like that and almost believe them.
And you can imagine what that does to a girl.
"Right after, I got a message from this other fellow who I've known for a year, suddenly asking me out which only proves my theory: The only thing a girl needs to get a date is another date."
"No, I already have a date."
Which is why you should say yes to the other one.
You're putting a lot of pressure on this Berger date.
You need to do something to take the edge off.
I am not going on a simu date.
How many new outfits have you bought for this movie?
"All right, maybe just a casual coffee to take the edge off Berger."
"Later that day, I got to thinking about the stock market and dating."
"If you have a bad stock, you can lose your shirt."
"If you have a bad date, you can lose your will to live."
"And if the date is good, the stakes get even higher."
After weathering all the ups and downs you could one day find yourself with nothing.
When it comes to finance and dating I couldn't help but wonder.
And speaking of high risk investments
I need to talk to you about something.
How about we do it over dinner?
Miranda feared it was possibly the most imperfect machine message ever.
And Samantha decided to say it with a basket.
I brought you a basket filled with goodies to acquaint you with your new neighborhood.
"If I reach for that, my towel will fall."
"A little while later, Samantha blew Chip the stockbroker."
Now that's what I call eating in.
"I never do this, but here's a tip."
Elan Pharmaceuticals is gonna go straight through the roof.
That was the best F ing head of my life.
"Just like that, their mutual fun turned into mutual funds."
"Later that week, I met graphic designer Willy Applegate for a late afternoon simu date."
"But I figured, you can't go wrong with a garden, right?"
It suddenly became clear that a simu date for me was a first date for him.
Are you looking at my sty?
"I was gonna cancel, but then I thought: Maybe she won't even notice it."
"I didn't even No, I wasn't looking at it."
Have you ever seen anything like it?
This is a bad choice of place.
It's like a cappuccino wilderness safari.
It was a sudden crash no analyst had seen coming.
And in yet another type of market I hope you're happy now.
I'm twice as nervous about my Berger date.
Caring too much is like a disaster magnet.
Can you catch a sty helping someone up from gravel?
Maybe they make something called Sty B Gone.
Did you know that Elizabeth Taylor converted to Judaism for Eddie Fisher?
"I'm thrown by the change of topic, but I do appreciate the trivia."
I'm reading her book My Love Affair with Jewelry.
She changed her religion for the man she loved.
"And a big old, honking piece of jewelry."
"Sorry, it's my potential sty talking."
Are you thinking of pulling an Elizabeth Taylor?
There's more to being a Jew than jewelry.
I'll meet you at the checkout.
Charlotte wondered just how far she would go for her true love.
Did you know that Elizabeth Taylor converted to Judaism for Eddie Fisher?
"From a not excited place I ask, is this something you might consider?"
I'm just trying to understand what's so special about being a Jew.
I feel like I'm on a game show.
"If this is really your bottom line, then you're gonna have to try and give me a reason, aside from your mother, that I can relate to."
"If we were to get married Now, we're just trading information here."
I would want our children to be raised Jewish.
Charlotte realized it was time to reveal to Harry her bottom line.
"If that's really the reason, then I have to tell you something."
I may not be able to give you children.
I'm challenged in the reproductive area.
"It's not hopeless, but it's difficult."
"I guess I should have brought it up sooner, but I never thought we'd even I understand if you"
You are the most wonderful thing that could ever happen to a schmuck like me.
"Seriously, Harry you want a family and what if I couldn't give that to you?"
But they wouldn't be your own.
"Charlotte York was deeply touched by Harry's humor, compassion, and acceptance."
"If this is Jewish, she thought, that's worth looking into."
"Meanwhile, downtown, Samantha had moved her neighbor from stocks and bonds to stockings and bondage."
You're under arrest for insider trading.
"Turns out, Chip Kilkenny was quite the ladies' man."
"And every time a woman went down, the Dow went up."
"Ma'am, can you undo your cuffs so we can use ours?"
All the good ones are getting arrested.
"And at a romantic restaurant, a year old single mother found herself on a first date."
"Jeez Louise, it's dark in here."
I can barely read my menu.
We need like another candle or something.
I think it's kind of nice.
I asked you here because I wanted to explain why I picked a fight with you last week.
And I know why you picked a fight with me.
You're upset 'cause I'm hanging around too much.
You think I'm getting too close.
But you don't have to worry.
I just started seeing someone else and it's going really good.
I'm not in love with you anymore.
All that stuff I said to you about Steve never happened.
Don't even so much as give me a look like you might be thinking about it.
"I can't ever, never see that look again."
I think you're overreacting to that thing that never happened.
"If you think I'm overreacting here, you should be inside my head."
I have to say this next thing but I will play along and not look at you while I say it.
Maybe if you had told Steve anyway
"I swear to God, I love you but I will have to kill you."
"I'm sorry, but I'm looking and I'm talking."
You two have a baby together.
This is not my perfect outfit.
I was just entering the safety zone when There he was.
My emotional equivalent to the big crash of '
"I call him Tater 'cause he looks like one, you know."
So where are you running to?
I'm just hanging out in front of this fabric store waiting for Tate's mom.
You wanna come and meet her?
We should get together and have coffee sometime and catch up.
There is the type of date you can't wait to keep.
And the type of date you both know you'll never keep.
"A block later, I realized if Aidan and I could survive that huge a crash and both get out alive there was nothing I could do on a first date I couldn't bounce back from."
I'm standing outside the Sony Theater near Lincoln Center and Craig's Room starts in half an hour.
I had my special outfit all picked out for tonight.
Then I got the popcorn and the assorted chocolate goodies.
You don't feel the need to use the Junior?
"And by close of Wall Street that day the NASDAQ was down, but amazingly, our stock was still up."
The only thing as delicious as those first few bites of a truly great burger are those first few dates with someone truly great like Berger.
"So I thought, That's cool, I'll do a book reading in my hometown."
Right about after the fifth question I realized that my mother is heckling me.
Ask anybody at the Downers Grove Barnes Noble.
Even a trip to Bed Bath Beyond can become an ecstatic errand.
I don't see you as a fish person.
The problem with the fish is you're into the whole fish theme.
"You have the fish soap, fish bathmat."
"It's a pyramid scheme, this shower curtain."
"Now, this is the one I have at home."
"Except on mine, China's covered in mold."
And here they thought communism was a problem.
"You know, it's a very intimate thing, shopping for shower curtains."
Wait till I get you into bedding.
"And, of course, those first kisses are the greatest kisses in the world."
We should get out of here before they turn the lights off.
The wait staff couldn't wait any longer and neither could I.
"I wanted Berger in my bed, bath, and beyond immediately."
I'm either leaving a very big tip or a dry cleaning receipt.
"The next night, Samantha convinced us to go to Raw where the scene was hot and the food was not."
You'd think a place that eliminated cooking could eliminate waiting.
"They don't cook the food, here?"
That's why they call it Raw.
"Sting, Demi, Soon Yi, soon me."
"Now, what is raw food exactly?"
"Vegan non dairy, and nothing is cooked over degrees."
"So, in other words, raw vegetables."
I read a review in The Times.
"People, the emperor has no oven."
I didn't get enough sleep last night.
How long have you been waiting to say that?
You realize you're now applauding intercourse?
"It was her first time, and she really likes him."
I don't want to talk about it.
"You know what, there was no problem."
I don't want to make a big deal about it.
It was just the first time.
"We're great in restaurants, it's like poppity pop pop."
"And the kisses are great, and then in bed there was no sexual chemistry."
Then what are we talking about?
"I wouldn't worry about it, Carrie."
"If the kisses were good, the sex will eventually be good."
It was so quiet that at one point I heard the Mbus.
"I heard the doors open, I heard people getting off."
At least someone was getting off.
We'd like to get you started with a little amuse bouche.
I'd like him to amuse my bouche.
"I see you guys are set for drinks, I'll give you a minute with the menus."
Our specials tonight if you're interested
Leek papaya patties and zucchini enchiladas.
I'm gonna need a pizza after this.
I'm gonna need a napkin to dry off my seat.
It is like lawn in a bowl.
Maybe some things should be over degrees.
Can we please forget I said anything?
"I do, but you have to put down your menus, because I need your undivided attention."
You'll have to shoot our waiter.
Will you look at that ass?
I have something a bit shocking to say.
"After I say it, I don't want anyone to react because I'm very happy with my decision."
"I love Harry very much, and he loves me."
"So, tomorrow, I'm meeting with a rabbi to discuss converting."
Isn't that a lot of hoop jumping for a man?
"Look, Harry is not who I expected to fall in love with, but I did."
"And he makes me laugh, and he says what he means and I feel like I can be myself around him."
And it is still the most exciting sex I've ever had.
While I'm eating this slice of pizza my boyfriend is home taping my favorite TV show.
And to which boyfriend are we referring?
You've traded Steve o for TiVo.
We don't talk of Steve o anymore.
I thought if I changed his name
"With TiVo, when there's something I don't enjoy, I speed right through it."
If only we could do that in life.
"He surprises me with things I might like, which is how I got hooked on Jules Mimi."
I stopped watching TV when people started putting leeches down their pants.
It's about a beautiful black man from Brixton and a white woman from Hampstead Heath.
"I don't know what that means, but apparently there's a great divide and he rents the flat above her hat shop and tonight, they're finally having sex."
"Carrie, it was the first time."
And sometimes you have to work at it.
Have you had to work at it?
I'm dating a digital recording device.
I have never had to work at it with someone I really like.
You should probably keep that to yourself.
"Okay, but, Miranda I got to tell you, it was not good."
It was more like a slow down.
It caught me completely off guard because I thought it would be amazing.
"From now on, people should tell it like it is."
Non dairy vegan ravioli: Kindergarten paste.
As I tried to scrub the smell of uncooked okra off me I started thinking about sexpectations .
"We're aware as smart, single women that we can't expect perfection but life still manages to throw us curve balls."
"Maybe once you're into your mid , it shouldn't be called dating."
It should be called Waiting for the other shoe to drop.
If it's not the sex between me and you then someone has to become a Jew.
Unless you're in a problem free relationship with TiVo.
Do you always answer the door without your shirt on?
That's why I rang you up.
The problem is in the bedroom.
"The next day, Charlotte boldly went where no York had gone before."
Where would I find the rabbi?
"Hi, my name is Charlotte York and I'm here today because I would like to consider joining the Jewish faith."
I need to report a very rude man.
I was saying my name is Charlotte York and I would like to consider joining the Jewish I don't know what is with these people.
Do you know how much I love you for doing this?
Do you know how sexy you look?
"That's it, I have to have you immediately."
Harry definitely had throw down but Charlotte was too thrown and down to care.
I'm feeling very rejected by your people.
They try to make it hard for you.
"Traditionally, they turn you down three times to make sure you're serious."
They were playing hard to get.
I don't care what any rabbi says.
Miranda was looking forward to another perfect night with her perfect boyfriend.
"But unfortunately, there was another woman."
I think I did something bad.
"No, boy is beautiful, is fine."
I sit on and then nothing.
"This is Jules Mimi, the morning after."
"And across town, I lay in bed willing Berger to call me which never works."
"This is the same excuse every guy gives, but in my case it's true."
A foot raccoon was attacking the village and I had to trap it and kill it and stuff it and everybody's safe now even the little Flanders girl who was stuck in a tree.
What have you been up to?
"Did The Times crossword puzzle, found a cure for cancer."
You did The Times crossword puzzle?
"I need three people to do Sunday's, one has to have the answers."
"I was thinking that if two people can be good in bed when they're not in the same bed, how hard a conversion could it be?"
I have some answers if you have cab fare.
"Fuck me badly once, shame on you."
"Fuck me badly twice, shame on me."
I don't want to dump him.
Aren't we getting a little old to jump to the dump?
"Look at Charlotte, she's becoming a Jew."
I need something that will make a guy come in his pants as soon as he sees me.
You talk to sales people like that?
Is this for a specific gentleman or do you just look for that generally?
It's for that hot waiter from Raw.
"I'm sleeping with him tonight, but he doesn't know it yet."
I think I have to talk to him.
"Honey, when it comes to sex, spray it, don't say it."
I'm trying to salvage your love life.
The only words you should be saying in bed are dirty ones.
I can't do that without alcohol.
"Then start drinking, because if you want a hotter sex life you're going to have to turn up the heat."
"They're not for you, they're for him."
Are you sure I can't talk to him about it?
"Honey if the sex isn't great, it doesn't help to say it's not great."
"That's usually a downer, and by that I mean"
"Plus, he must know it's not great."
He can't think this is good.
Is it possible he thinks this is good?
"As a matter of fact, I'm gonna take this."
That evening Miranda had one of those regrettable discussions that results from the belief that you and your partner should be able to talk through any problem.
We have been over this before.
I feel like you are not listening to me.
I turned the system off for minutes and nothing changed.
I got used to coming home to something.
Can't you work with me on this?
You told me to do that already.
I had my sexy lingerie under my cool couture and I was feeling good.
You look so hot in that shirt.
"Okay, we're gonna need some drinks."
"It's happy hour, so frozen margaritas are two for one."
"Since we were for two, I figured two for one was a good idea."
"And after three unreturned phone calls, Charlotte decided to make a house call."
I brought you some kosher wine.
"I'm sorry, but my husband can't see you now."
"Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude, but I think he can."
"What I am years old, I'm reproductively challenged."
"I'm in love with a Jewish person, it took me years to find him."
I don't have time to play these games.
"All right, Charlotte, lesson number one: You have to give it a rest because it's about to be Sabbath, the day of rest."
You want to be a Jew?
"But actually, I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend I can skip it."
"And Samantha was at Raw, ready to get things cooking."
I was here the other night.
"You come once, and you keep coming over and over."
For some reason the hostess keeps seating everyone in my section.
Suddenly Samantha realized why the raw food movement was a movement.
Women weren't there for the cold food they were there for the hot waiter.
I got held up at work.
"No, they called and said that they'd have to reschedule for a week from Thursday."
"Yeah, but I played around with a few things, and I think it's okay now."
"What do you mean, it's working?"
"I mean, you know, for fixing that."
"Yeah, Magda said it was kind of important."
"Yeah, I got this dinner thing."
"See you later, champ, all right?"
"Some things, like a broken TiVo, can be repaired."
"And others, like a broken heart, are a little more complicated."
Four hours and four courses of uncooked food later Samantha and her competitors waited it out.
"Maybe they were less horny, maybe it was all that roughage but one by one, women threw in the napkin."
Can I get you anything else?
"No, I'm just enjoying my delicious mushroom tea."
I would like to have some of that Key lime custard.
It sounds too good to pass up.
"Honey, you've put up a good fight but you have no idea who you're dealing with."
I'm going home with him and you're going home with Key lime custard.
So what do you say I buy your dinner and we call it a night.
"Meanwhile, I was finally confident I could heat up my sex life because I was a sex columnist."
"I was resourceful, and I was drunk."
I got a little something for you.
"Get ready, mister 'cause I got something under here for you."
Wait till you see me in these.
And after a night of raw food Samantha enjoyed an all nighter of raw sex.
Can I tell you a secret?
You didn't have to order all that shit.
I was ready to go home with you last Tuesday.
"Now you tell me, I ate a fucking cactus."
Get back down there and make it up to me.
Samantha was still having sex when it dawned on me that Berger and I hadn't.
"We both knew, it was now or never."
That morning I resigned myself to the idea that I would never again have frozen drinks or hot sex.
"Look, I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I'm way better than this."
I've been told I'm good at this.
Would you look at us in restaurants?
We're the couple you want to be.
"All right, we gotta make the bed more like a restaurant."
"What do you have there, a pet?"
"Berger, what if we're just not good together in bed?"
We had it all going on.
"I thought it'd be great, and I wanted it to be great and I choked."
I came over the next night and thought it would be better and
"We should be smoking, not choking."
I think sometimes the rhyme helps.
"Boy, those are some very sexy shoes."
"Here, throw some of that over your left shoulder."
"Come on, you want things to get worse?"
"I was gonna talk to you about it, but"
"I wanted to talk to you, but"
"I talk to you, you talk to me."
We should be able to talk about these things.
"That morning the other shoe dropped, and it wasn't bad at all."
"In fact, it was kind of hot."
"In New York City, it is a statistical fact that once every seven minutes, an unsuspecting woman"
My husband will be home any minute
"For Samantha, one of the perks of dating Jerry the actor was getting to stage full scale fantasy productions."
"I said, shut the fuck up."
"No, you shut the fuck up, and fuck me before my husband gets home."
"And then he pretended to tie my hands behind my back and the whole time he kept screaming, Shut the fuck up ."
"I tell you, it is so refreshing to be with someone who likes to fuck outside the box."
"And this is my friend, Samantha."
Violence against women is a very serious issue.
"Actually, I think the Supreme Court is working on that right now."
All fantasies are healthy and harmless.
"You know, as a guy, I've always been under the impression that rape, or anything in the rape family is just not a good idea."
There is no greater sound than your friends laughing at your new boyfriend's jokes.
That's not the only scenario we play.
"Sometimes he's Senator Smith, or Principal Smith."
"Miranda, how was your date with the real estate guy?"
"He was kind of cute, and funny, and"
"Dr. Smith, thank you for returning my call."
"Excuse me, he thinks I may have the mumps."
So how did the date end?
"I'm sorry, are you maxed out on girl talk?"
"So he kissed me goodnight at the door, I invited him up."
He couldn't because he had an early meeting.
"You think, even though he didn't come up?"
"It means he likes you, but he wants to take it slow."
"Please, I would love to have a man's opinion for a change."
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you.
He's just not that into you.
"Look, I'm sorry, but when a guy's really into you he's coming upstairs, meeting or no meeting."
"What about you're stressed out, you're on deadline, you have a migraine?"
Or a lot of guys are afraid of getting their feelings hurt and they don't want to ruin a friendship.
Or they're freaked out by their own feelings.
There's a lot of push pull out there.
"Yeah, I have to say that's all code for, He's just not that into you ."
"I'm sorry, but with guys it's very simple."
"If we're into you, we're coming upstairs."
I've spent my whole life deciphering mixed messages.
I've made a whole career of it.
He's just not that into me.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
"Look, if he's not into you, the guy's obviously a weenie, so"
It is the most liberating thing I have ever heard.
Think how much time and therapy I could have saved over the last years if I had known this.
I still think the real estate guy is gonna call.
"I think you've got an uncomfortable e mail coming your way, you know?"
"Something like, Sorry I haven't called."
I'm in a place in the world where they don't have phones.
The best part of a night out with your friends is talking about them all the way home.
"Charlotte is a trip, Samantha's hilarious."
How do you not love Miranda?
And I love that you loved her.
"Okay, your choice: Fudgesicle or Nutty Buddy?"
"When you went to the men's room, they were"
"What, am I talking too much?"
"No, I wanna say something and I don't want you to say anything back, okay?"
And I'm not saying it because you said it to me.
I was gonna say it before.
I've been thinking it the whole night.
I just wanted to say it again on my own.
In my euphoric state I knew there was only one kind of person who could tolerate me.
"It's the fastest I've ever said, I love you, but I could not hold it in my mouth."
"I love Harry so much, it hurts."
"Sometimes I look at Berger, and he's so cute I just wanna squeeze his face off"
This Friday night is my first official Shabbos.
"So I am cooking a big, traditional dinner for Harry."
I'm so excited to finally be a real Jew.
Just when I thought my week couldn't get any better I came home to find a little surprise from Berger.
From Berger's book to Samantha's books.
"I'm sorry, Ms. Jones but you owe the U.S. Government in back taxes."
"But, Auditor Smith, I don't have that kind of money."
"What are you going to do, take the shirt off my back?"
Take the shirt off my back.
Now this is what I call internal revenue.
"In my fantasy, Hurricane Pandora would be brilliant."
"If you're still not finished, it's all over between us."
"I just finished it, just this minute."
"Well, I can't date a slow reader."
"The question is, are you done?"
"Yes, I'm done, and if you would shut your trap I could tell you that I love, love, loved it."
You have your leading lady running all over town wearing a scrunchy.
"Nothing, unless you're writing about women in Manhattan."
"In which case, where do I begin?"
Many New York women wear scrunchies.
"In the bathroom maybe, when they're washing their faces."
I've seen women every single day all over New York City wearing scrunchies.
"No woman who works at W magazine and lives on Perry Street would be caught dead at a hip, downtown restaurant wearing a scrunchy."
"Man, it's a good thing I came along because you may know the fellows, but I know the ladies."
"Okay, can I read you my favorite part?"
"No, I'm done talking about the book."
Why did I have to get up on my sassy horse and ruin everything?
"Yeah, sass will bite you on the ass."
And the thing that kills me is I love the book.
I could have gushed about it all night.
Why did I have to go straight to the negative and just pick at it?
"I used to pick at Steve about everything: The way he held his fork, his grammar his dirty fingernails."
He has a new girlfriend for that now.
Do you think Debbie picks at Steve?
It's our little way of showing that we care.
I think I made it abundantly clear just how much I care.
You have to work it out with him.
Berger has single handedly changed my life.
"I still haven't heard from the real estate guy, but it's fine."
He's just not that into me.
"I think, right now, Berger's just not that into me."
So talk to him about it.
You two seem like you could laugh your way through anything.
"Yeah, it's that kind of thinking that got me into this in the first place."
One of the signs that a female gorilla is in love is that she can be seen picking nits off her male companion.
"And yet, in humans, nit picking can ruin a perfectly good evening not to mention a relationship."
Women are known to be more verbal than men.
But when does criticism that's constructive become destructive?
Are there times when the ladies should just shut the fuck up?
"The next morning, another woman was making too much noise."
What on earth is all that banging?
He's just going through a really hard time right now.
"Later, on her lunch hour, Miranda checked her Blackberry."
The uncomfortable e mail Berger had predicted.
"Then, when they get busy, it's like, I can't call."
"Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and I hope what I'm gonna say will save you a lot of time and energy."
He's just not that into you.
Having passed on the gospel to these New York women Miranda could only hope they would spread the word far and wide.
He is so gonna call you.
And as two women's fantasies were being shattered another's were being brought to life.
"I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you some questions, ma'am."
Am I in some kind of trouble?
"But, you know, Detective one little drink won't kill you."
Totally fucked up for eight years in Seattle
I have a presentation first thing in the morning.
Jerry had taken the fantasy into dangerous territory.
"No, dude, I said a seltzer."
"Meanwhile, Charlotte was hard at work on her fantasy role."
"The kugel's in the oven, the matzo balls are boiling."
We should start braiding the challah.
"Doesn't Shabbos mean day of rest, i.e."
"Okay, you don't have to holler."
I don't know what I'm doing.
Why did you call me over here?
"Because I didn't want to spend the entire week saying, Guess you had to be there."
Did Harry's friend ever call you?
"As a matter of fact, I'm seeing him tonight."
You think I can get away with this outfit?
"Can you read me what's next, after it's braided?"
"With her high school boyfriend, Charlotte doodled."
I think it calls for two cups of Mrs. Harry York Goldenblatt.
Did you get married while I was at work?
"No, but that's where we're headed."
"Actually, I've been making some calls and I was wondering how you both felt about November."
Most of the synagogues are booked through the fall.
Aren't you counting your matzo balls before they rise?
We have an understanding about our future.
We don't have to talk about it all the time.
I don't know what that means.
I would never have gone through all this trouble if I didn't know for sure that we were getting married.
"I'm sorry, I just don't want to see you get hurt again."
And ever since her reality check with Jerry Samantha had no interest in seeing him again.
"However, when a certain government official called she was more than happy to take a meeting."
"Secret Service Agent Smith, if you're here who's protecting the President?"
"You know, I changed my mind."
I thought of something even hotter for us to play.
"You know, when I told you the other night I was in AA, you bolted."
I'm afraid we want different things.
You want to tell me all about you and I don't want you to tell me all about you.
"I'm also demanding, stubborn, self sufficient, and always right."
"In bed, at the office, and everywhere else."
And that's just a little bit about me.
Let me tell you one little thing about me.
At least let me tell you my last name.
Your parents named you Jerry Jerrod?
There would still be accountants and undercover agents in their future.
"But that night, Samantha and Jerry got off on playing themselves."
"Meanwhile, I was looking forward to putting the scrunchy moment behind us."
"Unfortunately, it was staring us in the face."
"Okay, I'm sorry to have to do this but I do believe we are in the presence of a scrunchy."
"I also do believe, and correct me if I'm wrong that we are in New York City proper."
This woman does not appear to be washing her face.
"She appears to be standing in line at a hip, downtown restaurant."
So it kind of kills your New York woman theory.
Did they say how long the wait was gonna be?
"Hi, I'm sorry to bother you."
We're just wondering what part of New York you live in.
"But thanks, you made my whole day."
These people think I live in New York.
When are they gonna let us sit down?
"Downtown, over curried lamb and chutney Miranda found herself pleasantly surprised by Charlotte's matchmaking skills."
"I know, I've lost all feeling in my tongue."
"Listen, I know a great place around the corner if you wanna get coffee."
"I wish I could, but I really should call it a night."
"You're just not that into me, and it's okay."
I just really have to go.
"Paul, come on, you can stop lying."
Apparently there is one rare exception to Berger's rule and it often involves curry.
"After dinner, Berger ate banana cream pie and I ate my words."
Another thing I loved was the way you used the sister's phone calls as little landposts.
Anyway I just loved how those sort of punctuated the story.
It was just a really nice touch.
"Oh, my God, the introduction Brilliant"
"You're instantly on this guy's side, even though he's a complete mess."
"You know, you really just nailed him."
While I was working overtime Charlotte's work was finally coming to an end.
"Harry, you can come on in now."
"Since it's our first Shabbos together, I wanted to make it a little special."
I just need to get the candles and then we can say the bracha.
I cannot believe you made brisket.
I cannot believe you made all this.
What did I do to deserve you?
I've been thinking about blessings and you are such a blessing to me.
I want you to turn it off right this minute.
Let me just watch this one pitch.
I gave up Christ for you and you can't give up the Mets?
It's gonna be a long life if you keep that up.
"I gave up Christ for you, take out the trash."
"I gave up Christ for you, pick up your socks."
Do you have any idea how hard I worked to prepare this meal for you?
I went to Zabar's every day this week I had to make matzo balls just to get four that were the right size and shape.
Not to mention the months of studying and cramming like a maniac to convert to Judaism.
And what have you done for me?
You said you couldn't marry me unless I was Jewish and now I'm Jewish.
Do you know how lucky you are to have me?
Do you know how we look?
Do you know what people out there think when they see us together?
"Yeah, I know what people are thinking."
I just didn't think you were one of them.
Finally it was Charlotte who was on mute.
To think I bought a ring.
"The Mets won that night, to"
But Charlotte lost everything that mattered to her.
I just remembered another hilarious part.
"And later, on the corner of d and mea culpa"
You know the scene where the dishwasher guy is spooning up the Rice Chex and he's putting them back in the box?
How did you come up with that?
I'm not talking about the book.
I'm talking about what you're doing right now.
I just wanted you to know how much I loved your book because I did.
And I'm sorry I muddied it up with the whole scrunchy thing.
It's not that big a deal.
I think I'm gonna call it a night.
I gotta get an early start tomorrow.
And then there are times when a New York woman should not shut the fuck up.
You can't just pull that line on me and walk away.
"You're obviously still pissed, and I'm sorry but you can't just shut down like this."
We have to be able to say what's on our minds.
If you thought that I had made some kind of mistake I would want you to tell me.
"It's fabulous, and you said that to hurt my feelings."
That's how you made me feel that night.
"So, you could just walk away now?"
What was I supposed to do with that scrunchy comment?
Was I supposed to hop in my time machine and fix my entire book?
"I don't know what your problem is, but it has nothing to do with a scrunchy."
"Yeah, it's about the fact that my book is a big, fat, fucking failure."
"It's just, I already feel like shit."
"You trying to pump me up all night, not helping."
I'm sure this is all very sexy.
I want to say something and I want you to listen.
You're a beautiful writer and I loved your book.
And I still think you're very sexy.
And I'm not gonna let you make a joke right now.
Saying I love you is easy.
What comes next is a little scrunchier.
Harry hadn't called in two days except to say he was sending someone over to pick up his TV.
Mind if I get in there and wash my face?
"Oh, my God, where did you get that?"
"Why, you wanna try it on?"
You're gonna look so pretty with this scrunchy on.
"In every relationship, there comes a time when you take that next important step."
I just want to make the right impression.
They'll love you because I love you.
"For some couples, that step is meeting the parents."
"For me, it's meeting the Prada."
"You know, on my planet, the clothing stores have clothes."
So how often do you shop here?
I'm gonna guess more than once.
"If all my customers were this beautiful, yes?"
And this is his first time at Prada.
We have some amazing new things for men.
I'm here for my amazing new girlfriend.
Can I get you something to drink?
Some couples spend Saturday afternoon shopping.
I want to smell you on me all night.
"But we always do Friday, it's T.G.I.Fuckday."
My play starts previews this week.
I was thinking you could come check it out.
Three words I hope never to hear again.
I'm the one who should be hurt.
You always spend Fridays in me.
"You come see me in Brooklyn and afterwards, I'll make sure you come and come and come in the bedroom."
"You know, I never say fabulous, but if I did, I would."
That's what a real shirt looks like.
Does it also somehow open into a small studio apartment?
"My girlfriend used to talk me into things, and I'm a better man for it."
This is our first shopping trip together.
I want to take it slow.
Only thing more tragic is Jack not having Prada.
"What can I say, except thanks for the hooch."
"Carrie, do you know any fantastic gorgeous single women like yourself I could go out with?"
I may have found you the impossible dreamboat.
"Straight, single, and works for Prada."
Did you think I would throw away all my new religious beliefs just because Harry and I are no longer together?
I am not a fair weather Jew.
"Besides, I can't even think about dating again."
I'm way too sad about losing Harry.
You will start dating eventually and by then this Prada item may be off the rack.
"If she's not ready to move on, she's not ready to move on."
People can't move on before they're ready.
I can't even imagine dating again.
"I mean, what would I say about myself?"
"I was married and then I got divorced then I fell in love with my divorce lawyer and we were gonna get married but then I blew it and we split up, too."
Now you went and told the truth.
What are we gonna do about it?
I say we get all dressed up and go out for drinks Friday night.
"There's a Shit, motherfucker fuck shit situation?"
I have to go to the theatre.
"It's not sweet, it's pathetic how far a gal will go for a good fuck."
"And speaking of the theatre, that night Miranda continued performing her one woman show I'm Not In Love With Steve."
How was life on the playground?
The little bratty girl had a birthday.
I had to fight for it.
I'm getting a gut from all the cupcake action on that playground.
I wanna get home to see the Knicks game.
Why don't you watch it here?
"I pay for ESPN and all, and I've got all this extra food and all."
"Unless you have plans with someone, in which case"
For the guy who scammed me the chocolate cupcake.
The Knicks overtime turned into Steve's overnighter.
"All right, now I have to call somebody."
You have a Prada abuse problem.
It's the I never say fabulous fabulous shirt.
"Carrie, thanks, but you can't afford this."
You can't afford that stuff you bought yourself.
"Last week I couldn't, but voil?."
It's a check from our publishers.
They sold my book in Paris.
"I know, I can't believe it."
"Half off at home, big deal in France."
"So, you see, you have to have the I never say fabulous fabulous shirt because you are the most fabulous of all the fabulous men who never say fabulous."
The next day I met Miranda and little lord Brady for an early evening walk.
"If I get tired in about a block, can you push me around in that?"
Steve slept over the other night.
We were watching the Knicks game and it got late.
It was the most fun I've had in a long time.
"Then tell him that, I beg of you."
"He has a girlfriend, did you forget?"
He probably already knows how you feel.
"No way, I'm acting my ass off."
"There is no Academy Award for that, just so you know."
"Carrie Bradshaw, the toast of Europe."
"Miranda, this is Courtney, my publisher."
I'm gonna go home and make myself a welfare martini.
"Quote, Disappointing sales in my sector."
If it weren't for the European interest in your book I'd have gotten the boot a week ago when they started dropping all my authors.
They should've never dropped his second book option.
You tell him to get the phone book out and give me a call if he needs a drinking buddy.
Berger never said anything to me.
And I'm running around buying him shirts and shoving my big check in his face.
Why did I have to parade in and brag about that check?
It's okay to be proud of it.
Should I tell him I know?
Maybe you should wait till he brings it up.
"Move over, Brady, I'm getting tired."
"Pale with no arms, straight, and Jewish."
"Please, Harry and I just broke up."
"Char, you loved Harry, I loved Harry."
"It do, and it better, because you are knock, knock, knocking on sad gal door."
And nobody loves a sad gal.
You don't understand what this feels like.
Lost the love of my life?
Had an ass like two scoops of butter pecan ice cream.
I could see you with him.
You better get interested or you're gonna end up all alone and with no mans.
Would that be the worst thing that could happen?
Samantha wondered if perhaps she'd judged the arts too quickly.
So was it worth the trip?
"I'm not usually a fan of the theater, but get your cock out."
I felt like I was hit with a tranquilizer dart.
Did you at least like my monologue?
"After you dropped trou, all I could think was I got to get me some of that."
I hope the critics like it more than you.
I quit my restaurant job today.
They wouldn't let me off to do the play.
Maybe it'll be a big hit.
The promotion of this thing is all out of whack.
"You have this pathetic, sad little flyer and nowhere on it does it say the most important thing about the play."
"Now, that's a reason to go to the theater."
They don't have money for that kind of thing.
Is this really what you want to do with your life?
Stand in an empty theater talking some harvest to harvest bullshit?
You're gonna help me be an actor?
"No, I'm gonna help you be a star."
"Look, if I have to go see you act, there better be a red carpet involved."
All I gotta do is work on my craft.
All you have to do is work on your abs.
But we have to do something about your name.
I bumped into Courtney a few days ago.
Why didn't you say anything sooner?
"Miranda was with me, but she"
I don't want her to know.
"She's fine, it's no big deal."
What do you have to be sorry about?
This has nothing to do with that.
I think that check is great.
"Berger, do you want me to talk to my new editor?"
"Okay, yes, there's a bit of a flail."
they need strong women to charge in there and help.
I'm helping him with his career and Smith is the perfect name for the next big thing.
"Smith, the next it boy, is so it that the glitterati are migrating to Brooklyn to see him act."
Are the glitterati migrating to Brooklyn?
I got tickets for us all opening night.
"Invite everyone fabulous you know, and dress up."
I've got a whole red carpet thing happening.
Why are you doing all this?
"I could help, so I did."
And he isn't threatened by you offering to help?
"No, he's a whole different generation."
Younger guys aren't threatened by strong women having power.
Is it a whole generation or just him?
"As women's roles evolve and change, we assume that men's do as well."
There are hundreds upon hundreds of articles written about the new man.
But does this new man really exist?
Perhaps he's just the old man renamed and repackaged by some clever P.R.
Are the men of today less threatened by a woman's power or are they just acting?
Looks like it's someone else's turn to make cupcakes.
"I never did it before, but it can't be that hard, right?"
Do I look like the baking type?
Mix batter in a large bowl.
"Miranda, you don't have to do that."
"Someone needs to help you, and Brady really has no motor skills."
One condition: I get to lick the bowl.
I have the milk and eggs right here.
You really are gonna score points on the playground this week.
"We're having a party, and she said she didn't want a cake but she didn't say anything about cupcakes."
So how many cupcakes are we making?
H A P P Y B l R T H D A Y D E B B l E.
"Okay, let's just I'll finish those later."
"I'm not going, I'm not up for it."
"If I'm going to the theater, you're going to the theater."
"I'm at Steve's, and he had to go to work and I got stuck helping him make cupcakes for his girlfriend's birthday."
Why would he ask you do that?
"I thought they were for the playground, and then it was too late to back out."
What did I think would happen?
He would see how great I make cupcakes and be back in love with me?
"If I don't finish, Steve will know something's up."
"Miranda, you can't make those cupcakes and live with yourself."
"God, that's Berger in a cab."
"You get out of there, you go home, and I'll call you later, okay?"
"No, this'll be much more fun."
I haven't had her out on the open road for a long time.
I'm not really dressed very biker chick.
Not to be a total girl about it but I really can't have the helmet hair when there's a red carpet situation.
We haven't been out on this thing the whole time we've been dating.
I really want to take the bike tonight.
Think about how much fun it's gonna be going over the Brooklyn Bridge.
"All right, just don't go fast."
There is a little known relationship law.
"When your man is down and out, you have to get up and on."
I told you not to go fast.
It just feels fast because you're on the bike.
Couldn't you feel my hands digging into you?
"Yeah, I thought you were excited."
"All right, calm down, you're safe."
I am not gonna die on a bridge so that you can feel like some big man on a bike.
What the fuck does that mean?
You know exactly what it means.
"And I am sorry, but I'm not sorry I made that money."
"I worked really hard for it, and I never thought you would be the type of guy that would have a problem with that."
"But I guess I do, don't I?"
Are you gonna look at me?
I didn't think I was going that fast.
"I'm sorry, I'll never do it again."
"Well, I'll never get on that bike again."
"Look, I don't want to be this guy."
I don't want to be the guy threatened by your success.
"I swear to God, I will do anything, I'll do whatever it takes."
I don't want to be this guy.
"Come on, let's get this over with."
I used to be a party girl.
They just do that so that they can get it right for the papers.
"Look, I'm really not up to going in."
I'll just wreck it for everybody.
Would it be okay if I took off?
"You can get home with the girls, right?"
That is the worst Barbra Streisand I have ever heard.
"When in Brooklyn, do as the Brooklyns do."
"Speaking of the worst, I have, like, the worst seat I've ever had."
"And speaking of one alone Charlotte sat in the theater surrounded by couples and in one, clear, crystallized moment she felt what her life would be like with no mans."
So my friend Tony from Prada is sitting next to you.
"After all, what single girl in New York would turn down a gift from Prada?"
You always smelled like the rain.
That night Smith's Full Moon became a sensation.
"Full frontal, and he can act."
He's coming down with a cold.
You want to come out with me?
"Maybe we were all acting, all the time."
And tonight I was playing the part of the woman in the great relationship whose boyfriend was coming down with a cold.
"In New York city where no good event gets going before pm,"
it's a very bad sign when you get invited to something that starts at .. am.
What are you going to say?
"I'm just going to tell them that before am,"
"as far as I'm concerned, everybody's guilty."
I figure I'll be out in no time.
"Well, as long as I'm down here,"
I'm going to head over to J R to look at some computer shit.
"When you get off, call me."
"Well, aren't you going to write today?"
What did you think I was going to do?
Sit on my ass all day?
"No, I didn't mean it like that."
And it's also a very bad sign
when a couple is fighting before am.
You know what we need right now?
I hope you can help me with this.
I feel terrible but I don't think that I can serve jury duty today.
"You see, I work for myself as a freelance writer,"
and no one can cover for me.
Meanwhile another woman was having trouble juggling her duties
"I'm, uh, I'm going to be a little late tonight, work stuff."
Mommy's just got to go to work.
"No no, it's not big deal"
"Along with her coffee, feeling guilty have become a part of Miranda's daily routine."
You have done such a wonderful job with this event.
I just hope people will enjoy it.
Charlotte had been guilted into joining the synagogue sisterhood society.
"Now I know since Harry puh, puh, puh..."
You've been coming to temple alone
The break up was bad news for you
"Lenore, what are you saying over there?"
"Now I know, I don't look old enough to have a son your age but"
I have two single sons both perfect for you.
"Ah ha, Barbara, I told you I wanted to fix her up with my David."
Charlotte may have been there to arrange the cookies
"but Barbara, Elaine and Lenore were there to arrange her next marriage."
"Meanwhile, Samantha had used her pushiness to parlay her new man's hit off broadway show"
into a hot on broadway poster.
"Well, that's the first thing every woman in town will be saying after she sees it."
"And honey, I'm not even sure the poster does you justice."
The way God had Madison avenue intended
"Sometimes when you're sitting on a jury,"
it may seem as if all you're doing is a lot of waiting around.
"but to the contrary, the catalyst for the resolution of the lawsuit is"
the fact that you're there ready to hear the evidence and
You're not just sitting around but
rather playing an indispensible role in our justice system.
But now let's take a look at the flow of a typical trial.
"Whether you're serving on a civil or criminal trial,"
there's a general procedure that is followed.
"You may hear opening statements by the opposing attorneys,"
each presenting their sides of the dispute.
"I mean, a mango wasn't even a fruit you can buy into."
I do believe it is the oddest thing you can pull out of a briefcase.
"The moment he pulls out a pineapple,I want you to call me."
I'm on the worst date of my life
This woman from the temple set me up with her son
Call me on your cell phone and tell me something bad happened.
"Ok, then when the guy leaves I'll call you,"
you'll come back in and eat with us.
We've been dating a long time.
I asked for more bread but they haven't brought it yet.
I wouldn't normally get that but maybe something bad happened.
I know it was going to be terrible.
Would you dump a guy if I brought you carnations?
"No, but I happened to like carnations, especially the pink ones."
"In fact, I think they're making a comeback."
"I would, however, throw away a guy for wearing dark siders or top siders or any of the above."
"So, basically guys are just fucked."
None of that matters with the right guy.
Harry was bald and he talked with his mouth full.
Because he didn't bring you filler flowers.
You don't say that to her.
I was just trying to be funny.
"Yeah, it wasn't funny, I'm a slacker."
"I guess if I wear a top side, I wouldn't be here."
You folks are ready to order?
I'm going to start with goat cheese salad and
"then I'll have the tuna but, sir,"
can you make sure there's no parsley on anything?
Not even a sprinkling ever on the plate.
can you ask the chef if the marinade for the tuna has parsley in it?
Because if it does I should probably change my order.
Why don't you just say that?
"Because when I say that, parsley somehow,"
magically appears on the plate and I feel bad
because I have to send it back.
You didn't even order something that usually comes with parsley.
Charlotte decided to leave her second bad date of the night.
"Uh, you can just drop us at the corner of uh d and Madison."
"Whoa, actually, can you go around at d between Park and Madison?Thank you."
I can't believe you put me down in front of your friend.
Now you're going to tell me what I feel?
I'm not telling you what you feel.
When did you stop being on my side?
When did you stop being on my side?
I think we should take a break.
I think we need some time apart.
"Well, nothings haven't been great but..."
How long have you been thinking about this?
At third brownstone on the right.
"Wait, you want to take the break starting now?"
I thought you would at least come up and we need to talk.
I need some time to think.
I'm going to go out to my Hamptons house.
I'm supposed to decide what I feel about this with the meter runnung?
I'll call you when I get back.
I knew we were having problems but a break?
Some horrible job he needs to get away from?
A break isn't always a bad thing.
"Oh, come on it's a hop, skip and a week from a break up."
Or it's the thing that saves you from saying the things that you wish you could take back
"If Harry and I had taken a break, then maybe I wouldn't be out on blind dates again."
"Hey, remember when a break was a good thing?"
You'll be even more upset when your faces are all lined.
"As far as I'm concerned, the test of a good relationship is"
are you like this... or like this...?
That is the test of a good relationship?
Make fun but a bump in the road is never good.
And you shouldn't bother staying around to find out how not good.
Berger and I have a lot of good stuff too.
Complicated by the fact that the man had to go all the way to Long Island to think this through.
Maybe you can send him a postcard
That is the most blatant agenda pushing I have ever seen.
I just wish I knew what he was thinking.
What am I supposed to do?
"Just sit around, waiting to find out whether he chooses me?"
I'm doing that all day at Jury duty and it sucks
Why don't you use this time to think about what you want.
The next day I got to thinking about trials and trial separations.
"In a court room, a jury decides the outcome."
"In a relationship, the victims have to decide their own fate."
How can people mired in the mess ever figure it out?
Do we need distance to get close?
They should rename the west side highway the no way highway.
Ah... let me just pull out my files on the McKenzie case.
We're not here to discuss the McKenzie case.
It's been noted recently that you've been late to important meetings and struggling to handle your case load.
I don't know what you mean.
the deposition last Tuesday and the motion hearing last Friday
and you left early on Monday
"Way to watch my back, Fern."
With the new baby and all.
"But let me say as far as the McKenzie brief, Miranda Hobbs' kicking ass."
Where I'm doing a bad job is at home.
"So, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do."
"And may I remind you that when my mother died, I was back in the office on Monday."
I don't want people to see me.
Everybody's giving me shit about the poster.
My sober buddies are pissed that I'm shelling for liquor company.
My acting class thinks I'm a sell.
My Ma's running around every grocery store in Seattle
hiding magazines so my year old grand mother doesn't see my dick.
And I just don't see where this is going.
"For one thing, I was getting auditions."
I'm sorry to bother you but
"I just wanted to say that my friends and I are huge, huge fans."
How dose those guys toasting me mean my acting career's happening?
First come the gays then the girls
Charlotte was on a lunch date with Yenta number s son.
I mean I guess I just knew it wasn't going to work out.
I mean I like practicing pilates but I don't want to talk about it at all day with my significant other.
And... what are you looking for exactly in a
Look.... We don't need to do this.
I mean you know I'm gay.
The only person who doesn't know I'm gay is my mother.
So do you really want to know what my type is?
My brother will be so disappointed.
You went out with Fagel and Miskite and you can't go out with my David?
It's just these blind dates are so...
I showed David your picture from the last newsletter
and he thought you were a knockout
I told him you'd be at the next single in Mingle night at the temple
Now I know most people say that about their childeren but he is.
and he's even better looking in person.
Some people are bullied into blind dating
The boy got to sleep an hour ago.
"Well, I just guess I can stay here and get back to my work then."
That night the only thing Miranda put to bed was the McKenzie brief.
The next day the verdict was in.
Century the downtown discount store was the best part of jury duty.
I'm with men in plaid pants and I'm carrying a iron.
I'm just in it for the scotch afterwards.
I found the most unbelievable Anna Molinari dress
"So how's it going with that guy, hot dog?"
friends ask other friends how things are in their lives.
besides I don't tee off another for minutes.
Um... actually we're taking it slow.
"Well, we're kind of taking a break."
I don't know why I told him.
I think I crumbled under questioning.
You haven't been together that long.
What are you taking a break from?
"Well, sometimes a person needs a little space."
Spoken by the man who moved miles away.
"You know, a break can be a very good thing."
As long as you're alright with it.
I am very okay with it.
"With an armful of discount clothing, I realized I could no longer discount my feelings."
I decided to rent a car
and drive the distance to get closer to Berger.
I paid dollars to drive feet.
What did I think I was going to do?
Badger my boyfriend into being with me?
"I just keep thinking you know if I, if I stick with it,..."
You know how much I like Berger but come on.
No one can accuse you of not having tried.
insecure and somtimes he shuts down but
but he's also smart and funny like
whenever we're being pissy with each other
we did this fake Hollywood kiss bit.
Why is it so hard to admit that?
"God, I've got to break up with him."
"Magda, see you at eight tomorrow."
The next day Miranda decided to do something about that.
We both know that this isn't working.
"and as much as I would like it to, it's not just going to magically change."
I can't keep working like this.
I'm going to have to cut way back.
That night Miranda was there to put Brady to bed.
but there would still be times when she wouldn't be around.
so Miranda found a way to be... a round .
"And at bus stops, all around town"
Everybody in New York thinks I'm an asshole.
If you're going to be in this business you're going to have to be a lot more thick skinned than this.
"Ok, I understand you're upset but you're going to have to take a step backwards"
I need some time to think.
So there's a bump on the road.
You can't bail the minute things get rough.
Or as close to a frown as Samantha and her dermatologist doctor Peterson would allow.
"First, the gays, now the girls"
"A hop, skip and a week later, the industry followed."
Gus Fiansent offered Smith a part of a model hustler junkie in his latest movie.
So you grew up in Connecticut?
Charlotte knew how silly she sounded
The problem wasn't that David went to Yale.
The problem was... he wasn't Harry.
"but for where I am right now, you might as well be a gay man with carnations."
I'm just not ready to date.
You want to go back to my apartment and have sex?
"Well, I think it was worth asking."
I think I'm going to head out.
The only cute guy just left.
All that's left is the fatties and the baldies.
Charlotte could only hope that one of the baldies was her baldie.
"Out of all the synagogues and all the cities, you had to walk into mine."
And... being away from you just only made it all the more clear how much I love you.
I don't care if you ever marry me.
I just want to be with you.
I would be lucky... to have you.
"So if you can find some way to forgive me, if you could just call me,"
or just ask me out again.
I am so coming back next week
It wasn't a pineapple but it was just as weird.
and there was only one other person who would really appreciate it.
I knew I wasn't ready to let Berger go.
"When it comes to a trial, you have to listen to the evidence."
"But when it comes to the trials of love, you have to listen to your heart."
I didn't know what Berger's verdict would be
I hear they're making a come back.
I know things have been bad but I really think...
I want to try to make this work.
"Hey, you're never going to believe it."
Do you know the mango guy?
New York City is a great place to be engaged.
And it's an even better place to be enraged.
I didn't want to say anything until we were all together but Harry and I made up and he asked me to marry him.
He had it made based on the one that Richard Burton gave Elizabeth Taylor.
Even more fabulous than your first one.
"So, Carrie, what was your news?"
Berger broke up with me on a Post it.
"Read it and weep, my friends."
I thought you were going to break up with him.
"Yeah, I was, and I should have but he said that he wanted to try to work things out: A.k.a."
Leave in the middle of the night.
I remember when breaking up over the phone was considered bad form.
I once was broken up with by a guy's doorman.
"Jonathan won't be coming down, ever."
I am not going to dignify his behavior with a response.
I am not even going to leave him one of those angry answering machine messages.
"But it sure felt good saying it right now, even to you."
That relationship was a complete waste of time.
It's never a complete waste of time.
"Even in the worst relationship, you always learn something."
You might not wanna say that to a woman carrying a loaded Post it.
"But everything happens for a reason, even if you don't know what it is yet."
"If I had never married Trey, then I never would have gotten divorced and I would have never met my divorce lawyer, Harry and I wouldn't be engaged now."
Maybe everything does happen for a reason.
If Berger hadn't left me in the most horrible way anyone could ever imagine I wouldn't be free to walk you to your hair appointment.
We're all being protected by the universe.
"When it comes to men, you may have had it right all along."
"If you're never someone's girlfriend, you can never be someone's ex girlfriend."
I'm gonna spend as much time mourning this relationship as he spent ending it.
Let's go somewhere fantastic tonight and have a fantastic time.
What can we do that would be fantastic?
It's a new club opening tonight.
I think I have the invitation.
Listen to me being all hurt.
"Look how many men have broken up with you, and you're fine."
People say everything happens for a reason.
And these women are usually sorting through a break up.
It seems that men can get out of a relationship without even a goodbye.
"But apparently, women have to either get married or learn something."
Why are we in such a rush to move from confused to Confucius?
Do we search for lessons to lessen the pain?
"Meanwhile, Samantha was at home dressing a man, for a change."
"I called some designers and I told them that the Absolut Hunk was going to do TRL on MTV, and they jumped ASAP."
"You know, I'm not really comfortable wearing labels."
"If it's okay with you, I thought I'd just wear some jeans and this."
You are going to be the fantasy of every adolescent girl and sexually confused boy in America.
How'd I get hooked up with such an amazing girlfriend?
And that was a label Samantha wasn't comfortable wearing.
The car will be here any minute.
I promised Carrie and the girls.
But I will catch the replay tonight.
Should I hook up with you later?
Go out with the MTV crowd and have fun.
"And as your publicist, let me just say calling someone your girlfriend isn't a good idea right now."
So when anyone asks if you have a girlfriend you should say you are still looking and haven't found anyone special yet.
But I do insist you top up that tank with some Dior sunglasses.
If you're not wearing something the kids can't afford how will they know to look up to you?
"That night, as Charlotte was deciding what to wear she noticed that everything went with her new engagement ring except her old wedding dress."
I don't think I can go.
"Openings of hot new clubs are for hot, childless people."
I'm not even one of the hot mommies at Mommy Me.
I don't want to have to resort to this.
"But if I have to, I will play the Post it card."
Just explain to me why I have to leave my house to go to Bed.
Because this can't be the day that I was broken up with by a Post it.
This has to be the day that something else happened.
How about the day your friend discovered all her clothes are covered in spit up?
"And speaking of no excuses, there they were."
The jeans every woman keeps in the vain hope that someday she'll fit into them again.
I am in my skinny jeans.
I haven't fit into these since and that is only because I had mono.
"Miranda, I've never noticed before, but you've got one hot ass."
"I got pregnant, became a single mother, and stopped having any time to eat."
That's a diet I won't be trying.
I can't believe I am in my skinny jeans.
I am never taking them off.
"Charlotte, can I wear these to your wedding?"
"No, it's just I just feel kind of silly that I made such a big fuss about my ring earlier."
"Honey, a diamond that big deserves a parade."
But this is the second time around.
I already did the showing of the ring and the big wedding.
So this time I've decided that it should just be really small and tasteful.
And I don't want to disappoint you: I've decided not to have bridesmaids.
Since people often go to bars to try to get someone into bed it was only a matter of time till someone cut out the middleman and put the beds in bars.
Now this is my kind of place.
And I thought they were being ironic.
"If I had known it was gonna be like this, I would have brought my bite guard."
All the beds are booked right now.
"Damn, that always happens to me."
I have to find a bathroom.
Or do you just wanna stare at your ass in the mirror?
"What can I say, I know how to work it in Bed."
And I didn't even have to buy you dinner.
You want me to have them killed?
"Yeah, I knew you were all talk."
And thank you for letting me crash.
It's not that often I have such a beautiful woman in bed with me.
All the men in here seem kind of old.
"I'm not dating him, I'm fucking him."
Now I'm looking for someone else to fuck.
"Well, I think you may have come to the right place."
Is there no other club opening tonight?
It'll get back to Berger that I acted childish.
Just go over there and say hi.
Act like Berger is the last thing on your mind.
"I'll be calm, classy, and just say hello."
"Chris, Andrew, this is Berger's girlfriend, Carrie."
This is kind of uncomfortable but we broke up this morning.
"Yeah, I knew you guys had all kinds of problems."
And he was bad in bed.
You know that angry message I didn't wanna leave on Berger's machine?
I just left it on his friend.
I took the lowest possible road.
"I told him Berger was bad in bed, which isn't even true."
You're suffering from Post it traumatic stress syndrome.
I need to find a way to erase that message.
Go back over there and explain.
Just tell them you're hurt and that you didn't mean it.
"Great, now I have to admit that I'm hurt?"
That thing I said before terrible and not true.
I don't even know why I said that.
"Yes, under normal circumstances they are tough."
"Look, I don't wanna drag you into this but Berger broke up with me on a Post it."
"I know as Berger's friend you can't have a normal reaction but just so you know, the normal reaction has been"
"Not that I'm going around telling everyone, just some girlfriends."
"You know, I'm trying to understand why someone would do that."
"I assure you, I would have been very understanding."
"You all say that, but then you just freak and get all psycho bitch."
"All we're saying is there really is no good way to break up with someone, is there?"
"It's funny you should mention that, Billy, because actually, there is."
You can have the guts and the courtesy to tell a woman to her face that you no longer wanna see her.
"Call me crazy but I think that you can make a point of ending your relationship in a manner that does not include an e mail, a doorman, or a missing persons report."
I think you could all get over your fear of looking like the bad guy and actually have the uncomfortable break up conversation because here's what:
Avoiding that is what makes you the bad guy.
"And just so you know, Alan"
"Most women aren't angry, irrational psychos."
We just want an ending to a relationship that is thoughtful and decent and honors what we had together.
"So my point, Billy, is this: There is a good way to break up with someone and it doesn't include a Post it"
We have to get out of here immediately.
"So, what, you have a boyfriend?"
I just learned you should never go to Bed angry.
It was really great meeting you.
It was good to meet you.
So those guys will tell Berger that I'm angry.
"Come on, bro, give me a hit."
"Yes, that's exactly what my mind needs: Cloudiness."
I'm still too lucid on the facts of the day and night.
When was the last time you smoked pot?
I think I was wearing these jeans.
How do we even get any?
"I'd call my dealer, but he's at the Cape."
Damn those dealers and their summer houses.
My friends and I were wondering
I like her in those jeans.
Is it safe to buy pot from strangers?
They're our new friends with pot.
They're going around the corner to Drown the Hound.
There's a guy there who deals.
And I get the one with the glasses.
"My, when she scores, she scores."
And I thought they were being ironic.
"If that last place was called Bed, then this should be called Smell."
I promised Smith I'd watch him on TRL and this dump has a TV.
What have they got all over the floor?
Do peanut shells have to happen for a reason?
"I assume, in a place like this, that covers three drinks and a channel change."
Does the bride need another Jell O shot?
I just I wish I'd never been married before.
"But if you hadn't married Trey, you wouldn't have met Harry."
It's just I hate that this is my second ring.
And that this is my second marriage.
"I hate that I finally found the love of my life and I can't celebrate it in a big, big way."
You can do whatever you want.
Would you take a picture of me and my girlfriends?
"You know, she got engaged last night."
She's getting married to a wonderful man.
You have to be in the picture.
"Finally, Charlotte's inner judge was silenced by some very loud bachelorettes."
"Sorry, I guess he's not here tonight."
"Well, you can't cry over spilt pot."
I can buy you a drink.
"I said I was buying her a drink, dude."
That's the secret of the skinny jeans.
It's not so much a state of behind as a state of mind.
What do I gotta do to get a beer around here?
"I'm La La, and now you've seen him naked on a billboard right here in Times Square."
And now he's on TRL wearing clothes.
"Damn, but it's still all good."
"He is the absolute hottest, the absolute awesome the Absolut Hunk"
"Man, we have a lot of fans in the house."
Let's get right to some questions.
What is it like to be the Absolut Hunk?
I have to say it's been a real trip.
I've met some really awesome people.
You're hot enough to be on TV.
"I am dating, but I'm not seeing anyone special."
And even though Samantha had designed it herself she realized no one special was another label she didn't care for.
And to prove that Smith was no one special to her she kissed someone even less special.
"Unfortunately, he was someone special to a somewhat drunk person."
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
"Fucking city girls, you think you're such hot shit that you can go around kissing other girls' boyfriends?"
I'm gonna slap the shit out of you.
"If I ever fucking see you again I'm gonna put my shoes so far up your ass, you're gonna taste leather"
Very few women can pull off anger in a tube top.
This night is turning into a total bust.
"Oh, my God, I love you"
"Apparently, will buy you three drinks a channel change and a joint."
No good can come of it.
I'm not getting any reception here.
"As I contemplated the fact that my relationship had gone to pot, literally I realized no high or low would make this day any day other than the day I got broken up with by a Post it."
We have to take her downtown.
I am a lawyer and a mother.
She's an extremely law abiding citizen.
"Yes, but in her defense, she has had a very bad day."
Her boyfriend just broke up with her.
"Tell you what, I'll write you up for smoking in a bar."
"Come on, can't you just let her off?"
The official end to what will now be known as the day I got arrested for smoking a doobie.
"See, your Post it was your get out of jail free card."
"If you never met Berger, you wouldn't"
"I have to say, I'm starting to agree with Charlotte's way of thinking."
If I hadn't accidentally gotten pregnant by Steve I never would have had Brady.
And had no time to eat.
So I never would have fit into my skinny jeans and realize this city is full of cute men.
Now that's my kind of thinking.
"Okay, I know what I learned from my Berger relationship."
"Wait a minute, I just had it."
"You know what, I changed my mind."
You don't think everything happens for a reason?
I really want you guys to be my bridesmaids.
"You don't have to wear the matching dresses, I promise."
Can I get that in writing?
"I might never find a lesson in why Berger and I split but at least, for the moment, there was a banana split."
"My career had reached new heights, literally."
An editor at New York magazine thought I would be the perfect person to write about the ultimate challenge for swingers.
Wouldn't you rather be at Geoffrey?
They're having a sale on stripes
We'll take off your climbing lines and strap on your safety harness.
Please strap on anything that'll keep me from plummeting to my death.
"Feet shoulder width apart, just a little bit more."
Now put your right hand out in front of you.
Are you ready to grab the bar?
I'm ready to go to the bar.
"Okay, hold the bar in one hand."
"Two hours later, I was hooked."
I'm about to try a catch.
Maybe you should quit while you're alive.
Just listen to me and trust me.
Take your hands off and reach for me.
That day I didn't get caught but Samantha's zipper did.
This is one of the frustrating things about living alone.
There's not always somebody around to rip your clothes off.
"Hey, Smith, wanna come over and do me?"
What she meant was undo me.
But two birds with one stone.
And in Central Park a photographer attempted to catch two lovebirds sitting on a stone.
A lesser man might have told Charlotte to take a flying leap but Harry loved her too much.
I thought the point was to look natural.
That's what I'm trying to get you to do.
"One might ask, how natural is it to be sitting in Central Park in a suit?"
I read the wedding section religiously and I know what they're looking for.
And I really want there to be a York Goldenblatt announcement of our wedding in the Sunday Times.
"So, please, just a little less teeth."
"Charlotte York, I cannot wait to marry you."
Debbie bought it for him over at the Sixth Avenue flea market.
She also got something for you.
"You know, I was thinking, maybe we should figure out a time for the two of you to meet."
I know you're not comfortable with that.
I don't need to meet her.
She bought me a fucking candle.
"And it was an aromatherapy candle, for serenity and calm."
I was much more serene and calm before the fucking candle.
Women with candles replace women with cats as the new sad thing.
And get this: He thinks I should meet her.
I sense that he wants us to become friends.
You do not need to become friends with the new girlfriend.
"It's unnatural, uncomfortable, insincere and rife with ulterior motive."
But there is a baby involved.
"She's using Brady to get to me, and I am not falling for it."
"Speaking of falling, I tried the trapeze yesterday for that piece that I'm writing."
I have the most terrible fear of heights.
So did you fly through the air with the greatest of ease?
"At first, but then I couldn't do a catch."
"I had to let go and reach for the guy, who was very cute, and I still couldn't do it."
You are insane for getting into a harness without even a hope of an orgasm.
"Everyone, this is Harry's best friend Howie Halberstein, in from Portland."
I'm just here to drop off the photo proofs and the seating chart.
"We're gonna have a quick bite to eat, then I'm taking the place cards to the calligrapher."
"After that, we're gonna go around the corner and try to find our balls."
"Yes, Harry knows how to show a guy a good time."
"Howie, this is Samantha and Miranda and Carrie."
"You two, I see it happening."
"So, Carrie, I was thinking maybe you might show Howie around a little later."
Unless Harry needs me to ice a cake or something.
I'm kind of busy because I have to do a flying trapeze thing.
"I have a lion taming thing tomorrow, so that's out for me."
"But, you know, if you change your mind, I'll give you my business card."
All my lines are on there.
"Call me, I'll be waiting by the phone."
"Yeah, and in town for a week."
"It's the best possible scenario, because you know he's leaving."
"But it's like whatever happens, there's an expiration date."
"Please, I'm too old for a fling."
I can barely do a swing.
"If you'll excuse me, I have to go home so I can write about the fact that I couldn't do a catch."
"When you're young, your whole life is about the pursuit of fun."
Then you grow up and learn to be cautious.
You could break a bone or a heart.
"You look before you leap, and sometimes you don't leap at all because there's not always someone there to catch you."
And in life there's no safety net.
When did it stop being fun and start being scary?
I decided it was time to leave fear behind and have some fun.
Let go and reach for me.
I want nothing but lilies on the chuppah.
This isn't the first wedding I've planned.
"Jesus Christ, you're worse than me"
"And I don't want short, stubby, broken up dick candles."
"All right, call me right back."
I'm so excited about this wedding.
We're doing everything according to tradition.
"We're going to smash the glass, and the signing of the ketubah."
God forbid you fall off the chair.
Maybe we won't do the chair thing.
"Remember, when you're up there, pretend you're having a good time hang on for dear life, and for fuck's sake keep your legs together."
Nobody wants to see the bride's beaver.
Don't say that in front of my dress.
It's The New York Times fact checker.
"Yes, Goldenblatt has two T s."
You're not supposed to see me in my dress.
"This is bad luck, very bad luck"
"Oh, no, this is so bad."
I once had a girl in Long Island give herself a stroke.
"She pulled it together for the big day, though."
Hopefully I'll get cell reception down in Mexico.
"Samantha, a fan of expiration dating was about to enjoy one of the benefits of dating an actor."
It's gonna be cool working with Gus Van Sant.
I can't believe we don't get to spend my last night together.
Then it's not your last night.
Save that performance for Mr. Van Sant.
Would you get out of here already?
"And listen, when you're on location don't do anything I wouldn't do."
I was really looking forward to meeting her.
"All right, we just need to grab some things out of Brady's crib."
The last time I forgot Mr.
"Elephant, Brady acted like a big baby."
But I have not cleaned in room yet.
"Hey, wanna go to Blockbuster and rent a tape or something?"
"Okay, but this time I get to pick."
There's a lot of dust down there.
That night we all gathered at Charlotte's casual rehearsal dinner.
She came to my apartment with Steve and totally ambushed me.
I had to hide under the bed to avoid them.
Just her shoes and her nails.
Maybe you should just meet her and get it over with.
I don't want to meet her.
"If I meet her, she's real, and that means Steve has an actual girlfriend."
Apparently I wasn't the only one who had trouble letting go.
I just saw your fling go into the bathroom.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
Not even when it says so on the invitation.
Just go in there and see what happens.
"Worst comes to worst, you could always hide under the bed."
It was time to get back in the swing of things.
"Wow, this is kind of uncomfortable."
"Look, would you please stop calling me?"
I don't have time to chat.
I've got boutonnieres on my mind.
Final exams for Clown College or something.
"What would that entail, you think?"
"The seating arrangements in the little car, walking in the floppy shoes"
Maybe I would have a fling.
"After all, how bad could it be?"
That night Howie and I had sex like we were teenagers again.
"Meaning he had no idea what he was doing, and I didn't say anything."
"Meanwhile, Samantha was banging around as well."
That's the thing about getting used to a man.
"Not just her wedding day, but The New York Times."
"Now, that is a terrific smile."
I'm having a Jewish wedding and I look like Hitler
In your paper do I have a moustache?
"In your wedding section, does it look like I have a moustache?"
"As I feared, my fling had become a pain in the neck."
You do not look like Hitler.
The bad luck is starting already.
There's a little something but maybe it's just my paper.
"Clearly, Charlotte was bent out of shape, and so was I."
I'll take you to the Early Bird Special.
"Oh, God, don't make me laugh."
Is this still from your days as a Flying Wallenda?
"That's my official story, and it's partially true."
But this is a sex sprain.
"No, it was not good for me."
Are straight men still allowed to do that?
It's basically masturbating with a woman instead of your hand.
I got a suite at The Mercer for later.
"We can have breakfast before I leave unless, of course, we're busy doing something else."
I'm pretty tired from last night.
"I'm only gonna be in town for another day, and I want to get to know you better."
I know what we'll see means.
"No, the thing is you're just visiting, so I figured it was a one night kind of thing."
"If I'd known you were just using me, I wouldn't have made love to you like that."
We are here today to celebrate the union of two very special people: Harry and Charlotte York.
It's important for everyone here to be a witness to this moment for the Jewish wedding ceremony has two parts.
"The first designates to the community that the kallah, bride and the chatan, groom are for one another alone."
And the second part gives them to one another.
It's a gift and a huge responsibility.
As one man slipped a ring on one woman was still trying to slip a bracelet off.
It seemed to Charlotte that the wedding had gone from Jewish law to Murphy's Law.
It's the worst wedding in history.
Although I only saw most of it from here down.
Harry never should've walked in on me wearing my wedding dress.
I know but I wanted everything to be perfect.
"Okay, you have to stop with the tears."
"You already had the perfect wedding and the marriage, not so perfect."
I think this is a good sign.
"I think the worse the wedding, the better the marriage."
I have a stain on my dress.
You're just trying to make me feel better.
"No, I'm trying to get you to open your eyes, because you're missing it."
You have a wonderful man who loves you who'll be there to catch you when you fall.
Do you know how special that is?
I would love to find a man who's strong enough to catch me.
"So let's get to that reception, so you can fall on a cake or something."
I'm just feeling a little sad.
"Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?"
"God, it's time for the toast."
I would like to raise a glass to Harry and Charlotte because they found each other despite all the bullshit.
"I mean, people don't care like they used to."
Is this a toast or a roast?
And love means never ever having to say.
It was a Mazel Tov cocktail.
"Carrie said, The worse the wedding, the better the marriage."
Then I think Howie just got us to our Silver.
"I would like to congratulate my very brave friend, Charlotte who knows what she wants and who goes for it."
Especially when it comes to love some of us can't even say the words.
Maybe Miranda just got us to our Gold.
He's the regular Jerk du Soleil.
Do you think everyone knows I slept with him?
And they all think you're a big whore ah.
What's the worst that can happen?
"And, of course, this being a wedding, there was one more catch to go."
Who's ready to catch the bouquet?
It wasn't a perfect catch and neither was mine.
But I survived because I have a good safety net.
The single New Yorker's weekend is all about buying.
"The latest Vogue, fresh flowers and gifts for previously single New Yorkers."
I'm here for the Welker wedding registry.
I'll take the Newport soup ladle and three Bimini steak knives.
"Fine, I'll take four espresso cups and a pepper grinder."
"Yeah, okay, the Little Me activity chair."
"That night, Stanford and I were invited to celebrate the arrival of baby boy Bronson latest son of Kyra and Chuck."
"Hey, what you got in there, Stanny?"
The Peter Rabbit dish set with matching bib.
"Thanks to you, I was left with the Little Me chair."
I also got him a CD of Free to Be You and Me I loved Marlo Thomas
I played that album all through the fifth grade.
I wanted to run as fast as the wind.
I played William Wants A Doll so many times I almost turned my little sister into a gay man.
"The gifts go over on the table, and the shoes go there."
Kyra and Chuck don't like outside dirt coming in.
The twins are always picking things up off the floor.
Good thing I wore my party socks.
"Jeez, if I'd known I was gonna be shoeless I would have compensated with a big hat or something."
"Well, now I'm so teeny I might bump my head on the coffee table."
"Our hostess, Kyra Bronson, had made a name for herself in the early ' taking pictures of anorexic actresses on beds at the Chelsea Hotel."
Now she took pictures of fat babies in buckets.
"We come from the East , bearing gifts."
"He looks just like Chuck except without that sad, closed up hole in his ear when he pierced it in the '."
"Other people need drinks, and by others, I mean me."
"Waiter, there's a baby in my drink."
"Uptown, Miranda was putting her foot down in her co op board meeting."
"Look, we all want to find the perfect tenant for"
All I'm asking is that we not prolong the interview.
"Whatever decision we make about Robert, let's make it quick."
I've got a baby downstairs getting over the chicken pox.
"And suddenly, Miranda wasn't so bored at her board meeting."
"And I'm Robert, but you probably know that already along with my social security number and my jacket size."
"So, Robert, you're a doctor for the Knicks?"
How long have you had that
"Hey, you've had a great season."
I take it you're not a basketball fan.
And what is that supposed to mean?
On Page of your tax return
While Miranda was playing a game of pick up
"You tell him I'll do depositions Friday, but only if my client is ready."
Charlotte was picking up as well.
"What, you gonna push me on this?"
"Because if you push me, then I push back."
I don't have to produce my client for this
"Charlotte knew when Harry moved in, he would unpack his bags."
Why are you hocking me on this?
Can you not hear what I'm saying to you?
"Open your ears, ready, cause here it comes."
One tax return and a half hour of eyelash batting later
It was really nice to meet you.
And I won't hold that Mets thing against you.
"Frankly, I am concerned about his financials."
His alimony payments are awfully high.
It's the single ones who always throw the wild parties with all the girls.
"Okay, I think we all know what's not being said here."
The unspoken thing was that Robert was cute and Miranda was horny.
"And then we saw the most amazing house I swear, I had no idea who we were bidding against."
We got the house but we could not get a table at Nick Tony's for the rest of the summer.
We have held you guys captive.
"No, we've had a swell time."
"It's just It's midnight, he's gay."
He has to start his night.
"Then, of course, our landscaper takes off with half of our trees."
"We might have been one foot out the door, but my shoes appeared to have already left."
"Then they told us, That's what you get for stealing Billy Joel's firewood."
Was there another room for the shoes?
Mine seem to have gone missing.
I just can't imagine where your shoes went.
"You know, Jennifer was wearing sandals."
Perhaps she took yours by mistake.
I can loan you some shoes to go home in.
They say you shouldn't judge until you've walked a mile in someone else's shoes.
"The next day, over dessert I was still not over the fact that my shoes had deserted me."
I hadn't even done a full lap around the party.
I don't play favorites with my shoes but these were very special.
Who would steal shoes from a party?
Why in hell did you take your shoes off to begin with?
We had to for their kids.
Apparently we drag things in on our heels that make children sick.
"Please, it's children who drag the germs around."
Brady got the chicken pox courtesy of some kid who licked him at the playground.
"Actually, I kept waiting for the mortification that never came."
She said they might turn up and sent me home.
Those shoes are not turning up anywhere but a pawn shop in Brooklyn.
I'm gonna cry in my flan.
"Legally, she owes you for them."
I can't ask her to pay for my shoes.
"If you gave a party and told her to leave her baby outside in the hall and her baby was missing at the end of the night, believe me, there'd be payback."
That is the craziest thing I've ever heard
You have every right to be upset about your shoes.
I am so sick of these people with their children.
"Sitting next to me in first class, eating at the next table at John Look at that."
"This place is for double cappuccinos, not double strollers."
Mommy needs two hands to eat her cake.
"No, I don't like any children but my own."
Look at that dirty little rugrat.
"All children are beautiful, but not as beautiful as Brady."
"Hey, so how goes the big matrimonial move in?"
Harry's moved most of his stuff in.
"And I'm just trying to learn to compromise, because sometimes I can be a little rigid."
"There's just one thing and it's small, but it really grosses me out."
I was talking about Harry leaves his old teabags around the house.
"I thought you meant tea bagging, when you hold a guy's balls in your mouth."
"Why is it called Oh, I get it"
"Because they hang, and the dipping."
Now I've lost my shoes and my appetite.
"You now what I love about living with you, besides those nutty soaps in the bathroom?"
Honey I need to talk to you.
"I really don't mean to be a nag, but it's just, well It's this."
"You leave them all over the house, and they stain."
Maybe you could just try to be a little more careful.
"I though I was doing so well, too."
"I've been really trying to watch my ass, now that I'm living in your house."
I want you to be yourself.
"Yeah, well, myself is pretty much a bull in a china shop."
Then you're a bull in our china shop.
I have a feeling you had a little something to do with that.
Let's just say you owe me bigtime.
I must have gotten it from my kid.
"Oh, I thought you were single."
It was the perfect first conversation.
"All right, give me the lotion and cotton balls."
You don't really say stat ?
"No, but it sounds good, doesn't it?"
So this is the little germ disseminator.
I had the chicken pox when I was four.
I really want one of these some day.
"You know, I could do this myself."
"Okay, Miss Hobbes, I think you'll live."
"For Miranda, Robert was just what the doctor ordered."
I thought you might want these back.
You didn't have to return these.
I had forgotten all about them.
Did you ever find her sandals?
"Well, if she took my shoes, she would have left her sandals."
Just being a bit of a shoe detective here.
"Oh, my gosh, Carrie, I am such a shit"
I should have offered to pay you for them.
"No, you don't have to do that."
"You know, you have kids and you lose all sense of social decency."
"Milo, honey, put your trucks back for Mommy."
"Okay, this is an awkward conversation."
I just think that's crazy to spend that much on shoes.
You know how much Manolos are.
"Sure, before I had a real life."
"But Chuck and I have responsibilities now: Kids, houses wow"
"No offense, but I don't think we should have to pay for your extravagant lifestyle."
"I mean, it was your choice to buy shoes that expensive."
"Yes, but it wasn't my choice to take them off."
I left there covered in shame.
"But she isn't, that's the thing."
She's become this whole other person.
It's like she's had two caesarians and a lobotomy.
She owes you for those shoes.
"No, it's not about the money."
I'm talking about a woman's right to shoes.
Why did she have to shame me?
Because she's trapped in a hell of her own making.
I am dying to scratch these
"But if I do, it'll be worse."
There's literally a pox on my house.
If there wasn't a Jules Mimi marathon on BBC America this weekend I'd have jumped out the window.
"Hey, speaking of handsome black men, have you spotted any more of Dr. Knicks?"
"As a leper, I'm laying low."
"But according to my sources, he's officially in the building."
Is it bad that my life is filled with shoes and not children?
And she is a fucking bitch for making you feel this way.
When we were young Marlo Thomas sang to us about accepting each other and our differences.
But then we got older and started singing a different tune.
We stopped celebrating each other's life choices and started qualifying them.
Is acceptance really such a childish concept?
Or did we have it right all along?
When did we stop being free to be you and me?
"The next morning, Charlotte learned just how free the real Harry could be."
"Oh the shark has pretty teeth, dear"
And he shows them pearly white
Are you gonna take a shower?
"Apparently, it took next to nothing to make Harry feel comfortable."
She wanted to see Harry be himself in her home.
She just didn't need to see that much of him.
"Meanwhile, I decided to bare all to Kyra."
Listen I feel weird about what happened the other day.
We've been friends a really long time and I just want to clear the air.
"Oh, my God, Carrie, I'd forgotten about that days ago."
"I've been thinking a lot about it, and"
"Man, you must have a lot of time on your hands."
"Carrie, can you hold on for one second?"
"You know what, I am Santa."
"I did a little mental addition and over the years, I have bought Kyra an engagement gift, a wedding gift."
"Then there was the trip to Maine for the wedding, three baby gifts."
"In toto, I have spent over celebrating her choices."
And she is shaming me for spending a lousy on myself?
"I mean, if you got married or had a child, she'd spend the same on you."
"And if I don't ever get married or have a baby, what?"
"If you are single, after graduation there isn't one occasion where people celebrate you."
I am talking about the single gal.
Hallmark doesn't make a congratulations you didn't marry the wrong guy card.
And where's the flatware for going on vacation alone?
Why should I get wedding gifts?
I'm thrilled to give you gifts to celebrate your life.
I just think it stinks that single people are left out of it.
"So the moral of the story appears to be: Until I get married, I won't be seeing nothing from Kyra."
"Meanwhile, Samantha was trying to have a working lunch."
"Look, I need to get him three VIP seats and"
Look at you eating your pesto.
"No, I don't want any shitty house seats."
I understand that my cell phone may be annoying to some but what are you doing about that noise?
There's nothing we can do about that.
And that was all Samantha had to hear.
I understand that your child and I have to coexist in this city.
But perhaps you could take him somewhere more appropriate for a Happy Meal so I could have a happier one.
I've made my point and he's made his.
Do you know what we need to bring back in this house?
Charlotte realized there was something grosser than teabags all over her house.
Her husband's teabags all over her new white couch.
"I'm trying to be less rigid, and I really do want you to be yourself in our house."
I know you do and I appreciate it.
And I'm almost used to the whole naked thing.
I knew it was too much.
But I can put on clothes.
I want you to be yourself.
Maybe you could put something between yourself and the white couch.
We've got kind of an ass white couch situation here.
I can see your feet under the door.
I just came by to check up on you.
"I've seen a tall man's shinbone poking through his calf, so"
I wanted to give him this.
I'm pretty sure his hand eye coordination is still a little sub par to make the team.
"If he's gonna go pro, we gotta start him young."
"Right next to her there is Jules, and they've slept together a couple of times but Jules may be involved with the girl who works in the sausage shop."
He seems to be pretty into her now.
That and my cable's not hooked up yet.
"Jules, you know, you didn't have to bring the rent over in person."
What's a few tube stops between friends?
I love a brother with an accent.
Do you think we'll stay friends after this?
"That night, I decided I couldn't wait for a ring."
And so I gave someone else one.
"Mommy, and Daddy, and baby Henry, and us aren't here."
I wanted to let you know that I'm getting married.
And I'm registered at Manolo Blahnik.
"One giant step for me, one small step for single womankind."
And could you please watch your children?
We don't want them touching the shoes.
It was my very first wedding present.
"The fact is, sometimes it's hard to walk in a single woman's shoes."
That's why we need really special ones now and then.
To make the walk a little more fun.
I didn't go to my high school reunion.
So when my high school sweetheart called me for a reunion I was curious to see if he looked like the boy I used to make out with in front of my locker.
Can you tell me how to get to Chemistry class?
I knew you looked great 'cause I saw you on the cover of your book.
"But I have to say, even better in person."
"God, I'm so glad you called."
"I'm going to be spending the month in Connecticut, so I had to look you up."
I heard you married somebody that you met in business school.
"I got divorced, like, two years ago."
So I'm on my own again.
My high school boyfriend spoiled me for life.
I put our names down for a table.
"Look, earlier you said maybe you might have dinner plans."
Was that in case I turned out to be a
But my fictional plans fell through so I'm available.
"Miranda had no plans that night so she was thrilled when her cute, new neighbor stopped by."
I didn't expect you home on a Saturday night.
I just got Brady to sleep.
"Now, do you sing to him?"
"Listen, I have these two courtside seats for the Knicks charity game at the Garden next Friday night."
Miranda wasn't sure if it was a charity game or just charity.
I didn't even ask what you were doing in Connecticut.
I spent the last decade working my ass off in Denver so I decided to take a month off.
Spend some time at sea level.
"So I've just been relaxing in the country, sorting through some things, you know."
Sometimes you need to get away.
Sometimes you wonder why you stayed away so long.
"I feel like I want to kiss you, but I I don't know what"
"I mean, this isn't a first date."
We were in a lip lock for most of
That's a lot better without the gearshift sticking up my ass.
"It was a romantic, hot summer night followed by a miserable, hot summer day which was the fourteenth miserable, hot summer day in a row."
We just dropped by the Soho House for a dip.
"I mean, what else can you possibly do in this heat except sit by the pool and drink cocktails while they mist you with Evian."
"I'm running to a lunch, otherwise I'd be up there myself."
There's a pool a block from my apartment and I can't get in.
You have to be a member and I'm on a bullshit wait list.
Don't they know who you are?
"And, more importantly, who we are who need to be at the pool with you."
"You know, in high school, all you had to do was jump a fence and you could be in somebody's pool."
"Speaking of high school, I saw my high school sweetheart and I think I might like him."
You could end up with your high school boyfriend.
"Okay, let's not jump the gun."
It was the best date I've had in a long time and I wasn't even thinking it was a date.
When he kissed me good night
Because I actually remembered what it felt like to kiss him.
Imagine if you slept with him.
We never went all the way.
"And now, I think we've waited long enough."
He doesn't even live in New York.
If I had the guy in high school what have I been doing for the past years?
Why did you two break up?
"I broke up because I thought, There must be better guys out there."
That night I started thinking about my retro relationship.
"Since high school, most women I know have acquired much better taste in clothes, hairstyles, and food."
Maybe we were better off when we thought less and kissed more.
Have we graduated past our ability to find true love?
"When it comes to matters of the heart, did we have it right in high school?"
Samantha was too cool to belong to any clubs in high school so she refused to believe that any club was too cool for her now.
Especially since New York in August is not cool at all.
I'd like to know what's holding up my membership.
I've been on the wait list since June.
"Yes, I'm sorry, but we are not currently admitting any new members."
"The pool is so fabulous, we're at capacity every day."
Do you know who I am?
But we can't accommodate you right now.
"Can I at least use the restroom before I go, or is there a wait list for that as well?"
"Down the corridor on your left, the door marked WC."
"Miss, did you leave your card on the sink?"
Since they didn't seem to know who she was at the Soho House she figured she could be Annabelle Bronstein.
"The next day, Samantha tested the waters with her fake ID."
"Excuse me, can I get you something to drink, Miss Bronstein?"
"Yes, but I'll just pay cash."
"Meanwhile, a fight was about to break out in the cafeteria."
"But this time, Cafeteria was a trendy restaurant in Chelsea."
"Come on, we're going over there."
Because you're in a tank top.
Can't swing a dick without running into someone you know.
"We'd love to stay and chat, but we have to go get our tuxes for the prom."
Did you say the prom ?
"Yes, it's a big fundraiser at the gay lesbian bi transgender center."
"What's the theme, Queer and Queerer ?"
I have the best memories of my prom.
I missed my prom in high school because
My girlfriend and I broke up the night before because
Those two should be going to the gay lesbian and prostitute prom.
I happen to know that Marcus used to be a gay escort.
"Honey, wake up and smell the K Y."
I was flipping through a vintage issue of Honcho.
I saw his ad in the Rauncho section.
Worst hustler name I ever heard.
He and Stanford are in love.
"Well, according to Honcho, he used to be in love all over town."
I don't want to see it.
I wish I didn't know this.
"Probably not, so maybe we shouldn't talk about it in Madison Square Garden."
I don't think that these people know those people.
Look at how cute he is.
Did you see him look at me?
These seats are too good to be casual.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Knicks City Dancers."
Did I ever tell you I was a cheerleader?
"No, because you knew I would mock you endlessly."
Did you used to do that?
"No, we just did some kerkies and some kicks."
"It was Friday night, it was the big game and Miranda was jealous of a cheerleader."
"Two hours later, the game ended and Miranda felt like the loser."
"No, you have to go over there and talk to him."
Are you gonna do a herkie now?
Just you go over there and flirt a little bit.
The Knicks and Madison Square Garden thank you for coming.
"Meanwhile, I invited Jeremy to come over and watch a movie which in high school was code for, Come over and make out."
Last train leaves in half an hour.
I think we should go all the way.
"And now we can, and your mother won't walk in with her laundry and her TaB."
"Carrie, I need to be honest with you about something."
That's the worst thing you can hear from someone you really like.
I'm not really just taking time off.
I'm sort of in a mental institution.
"No, actually, that's the worst thing you can hear."
"I wanted a man who would commit, not a man who was committed."
"Apparently, we have to be more specific."
But how is he able to see you?
He says it's not really a mental institution it's a therapeutic community.
That's supposed to be a good one.
Why haven't we heard about that?
Because I'm good at my job.
No one wants to admit they're in a loony bin.
Think about what we have to go through to date.
I am and I am competing with a cheerleader.
"And even when you get the guy, you never know what fun surprise might be revealed."
"Let me tell you something, ladies."
"In a good relationship, there are no surprises."
"I know everything about Marcus, and Marcus knows everything about me."
I don't think he knows everything.
"Charlotte, like all girls, learned at an early age that the only way to get rid of information you don't want to have is to pass it on."
Anthony found it in an old issue of Honcho magazine.
Someone better tell me where this came from right now.
I got it from Anthony but I told him you and Marcus were very much in love.
Charlotte was still a cheerleader for love.
"But like the Knicks, her team was having a bad season."
"Well, you think you know somebody"
"Excuse me, which one of you is Annabelle Bronstein?"
Miss Bronstein is in London for the week.
"As I was saying, dear sir I am Annabelle Bronstein."
I'm fairly certain you're not Annabelle.
I've spoken to her on the phone.
I am absolutely Annabelle Bronstein and I do not pay annually to be treated like this.
"Now, ring round the waiter and have him tally up the drinks."
She's got a case of the Madonnas.
"I'm sorry, but I know for a fact that Annabelle lost her card."
"Yes, I thought I did but it was on top of the telly."
"And Miss Bronstein is from Sussex, as am I and I'd venture to guess that you are not, in fact, from the UK."
"On any given day, there are a lot of versions of crazy right here in New York."
"Today, Annabelle Bronstein had multiple personalities and at least two accents."
Where did you disappear to after the game?
"I was gonna thank you, but you were talking to that girl."
"Now, see, how would I know that?"
Would it be any clearer if I did this?
I wanted you to have these.
"In case I lose any more of mine, I want to know where I can find a stash."
Do you want to come in?
"No, I think it's great what you're doing"
"I know I probably threw you for a loop the other day, but"
"I should probably just come right out and say something about this, but I"
"Truth is, I haven't worked out my rap on it yet."
"Well, it's a tough thing to slip in."
Would you like to share an appetizer?
"The thing is, I think I made it sound worse than it is."
"If you saw Juno Spears, you'd see it's not a cuckoo's nest."
It's more like Canyon Ranch for the brain.
I don't want to lie to you.
I am going through some pretty heavy stuff.
Trying to figure out why some things seem to be harder for me than they are for other people.
I think my family has something to do with it.
"It's good to blame the parents, right?"
So I figured I could spend the next five years in therapy or spend the next month and deal with it intensively right now.
You make a very good case.
I just wanted to explain myself so that I didn't become known eternally as that nut case you dated back in high school.
How about my high school boyfriend who was the best kisser ever ?
"You're not bad yourself, either, you know."
That night we went all the way.
And we weren't the only ones.
"The next afternoon, my other crazy boyfriend stopped by."
But he's been off the market since
"Yes, and he says he did it just to put himself through dance classes."
"But if that's true, then why keep it a secret?"
"Yes, but it's not the escort thing but the secret thing that's bothering me."
I was the last to know.
I don't want to hear the truth from some bitchy queen with back issues of Honcho.
"And I still have to go, because I'm on the decorations committee."
Will you please go with me?
I have to visit my boyfriend at the asylum.
He wants me to see the place for myself.
It's supposed to be like Canyon Ranch.
"Who are we to say, he's got issues, he's getting help?"
"Usually, that's considered a good thing."
"You slept with him, didn't you?"
"You sleep with someone, you start rationalizing away all the red flags."
At least he was honest about it.
"Apparently, the Juno Spears Center was harder than the Soho House to get into."
"Even as a visitor, I could see how this was a very relaxing place to get away to."
There are great hiking trails all around here.
Maybe later we can do a hike.
But I will fill you in on something I discovered.
I started to think maybe the Juno Spears Center should be mandatory for New Yorkers.
Like the Hamptons or Fire Island.
I guess that doesn't happen very often at Canyon Ranch.
This is a full on psychiatric facility.
You're definitely the sanest person here.
That's like being the best house on a bad block.
People would advise you against buying it.
Maybe it wasn't the wisest thing to start something while I was still in here.
Maybe when I get out in eight to ten months
My doctor still thinks I have a lot of work to do.
"To be honest with you, I'm comfortable here."
I like that everybody's craziness is out in the open.
We're just in very different places right now.
"Ironically, it was the sanest breakup I ever had."
"And now, the Queen and Queen of our prom Carrie Bradshaw and Stanford Blatch."
This is my best prom ever.
"Believe me, I'm glad to be back with the normal people."
You know the craziest thing of all?
I somehow thought that after everything I've been through I might end up with my high school boyfriend.
I don't think my story's going to get tied up like that.
Your boyfriend might get tied up.
I might be dating him in eight to ten months.
"Honey, I didn't tell you because it's part of my past."
It's not who I am anymore.
"I was really messed up back then, but I've got it together now."
We have to have a dance.
Why don't I get some punch?
"Did you ever, ever sleep with that little bitchy pine nut, Anthony?"
"So, maybe it won't look the way you thought it would look in high school."
But it's good to remember love is possible.
"There are some New York nights that are monumental, gigantic, historic."
"Bet you can't get your steaks like this in your little Napa Village,"
Where do yo think these cattle comes from?
"Well, what we lack in livestock,"
we make up for in cabs.
"Fine, you win, and I don't wanna fight about it."
"Let's fight, then we can make out."
"So, what's on your New York agenda?"
"Making some deals, breaking some hearts?"
Can I tell you a secret?
I'm having a little heart thing done.
"So I'm getting a, you know,"
I can kiss these good bye.
They do a million of these a day.
It's like having your teeth cleaned.
Could you bring some extra napkins?
"Uptown, there was a different kind of dinner being prepared."
With less cholesterol and no tears.
"How ever you got in here,"
had quicky become her new boyfriend.
She was very excited at the idea of
someone actually using your kitchen to prepare food.
I didn't know you could cook.
How am I gonna repay you for all this?
I don't have to work until seven.
We can spend the whole day together.
Bet you have a few personal days stored up.
"Truth be told, Miranda had never taken a personal day in her entire career."
"But then again, no one had ever made her enchiladas before."
"Steve, what are you doing here?"
"Oh my god, are you ok?"
Let me take a look at that.
Is it weird that I just called you that?
"Hey, do you wanna help me here or what?"
"Yeah, yeah, let's take this in the bathroom."
Bend your head forward slightly and have a seat.
"So, how long have you two been hanging out?"
I was gonna mention it when the time was right.
I was just waiting for the right time.
"It's a little trick we use at work,"
"What are you, some nose guy or something?"
"So, that pretty much solves the problem"
of how Robert and Steve are going to meet.
I guess I can check that off my list of things to do.
I will continue to be horrified by that story all day long.
"he was in such a vulnerable position with the sex and the bloody nose,"
"She's being fucked by a hot, black doctor and Steve had a tampon up his nose."
"Ok, I hate to admit this,"
but there is part of me that took some pleasure in the whole thing.
"It's not as like you planned it that way,"
"So, why do I even care what Steve thinks?"
Because you've been through a lot with him.
Some people just get under your skin and stay there.
"When I say Big the other night,.."
"Yeah, he's here for a little heart thing."
Is he on the list to get one?
And you're going to feel incredibly bad in a minute.
He's here because he's having heart surgery.
It's actually a fairly routine procedure.
This is exactly what happened the other night when he told me.
"I know, I know he's gonna be fine."
what is going on with me?
"Bitsy Von Muffling had recentlymarried cabaret singer, Bobby Fine"
known to everyone but Bitsy as the gayest gay man alive.
"It's a girl Bobby is so excited, he's already got two names picked out."
We're gonna wait to what she looks like.
And I owe it all to Dr. Mao.
"Or as we call him Dr. Wow,"
"Seriously, I couldn't take it anymore with the IUl's, and the IVF's, and the I give up."
"Anyway, then I go to this guy, and poof, I'm with child."
"I don't know how the hell it works, but this guy could get a cactus pregnant."
It was great seeing you girls.
That woman is like years old.
I have got to go see that Dr. Mao.
I have a three o'clock with Dr. Mao?
I know someone who tried for years and never saw results.
Did she drink the teas religiously?
Tell her to drink the teas.
My friend Lois got pregnant on her third visit.
"I knew a woman who was told she'd never get pregnant ever,"
"And guess what,she's expecting her fourth this Christmas."
And then this woman said that the teas and the herbs are really important.
"And I'm just wondering because I started facility treatments with my first husband,"
"So, this woman thought that I should.."
"Let's just concentrate on what we're doing here,"
"Now, I'll be back in twenty minutes."
Just relax with your own thoughts.
"I knew a woman who was told she'd never get pregnant ever,"
she's expecting her fourth this Christmas.
From eastern medicine on the Upper West Side
to western medicine on Upper East Side.
"Boy, you should've seen your face."
"He says that to all the nurses, doesn't he?"
"Oh boy, there she goes again."
"Meanwhile, Samantha welcomed Smith back from his movie location"
"Now, put your index finger on my clit."
A little bit more to the left.
Did you take a directing seminar while I was gone?
"Ok, now keep your finger there but move your thumb."
"So, what do you want to eat?"
Smith tried the most intimate hand position of all.
I have a new sympathy for the disabled.
"Oh, I'm fine, I just fell into one of those hatches on the sidewalk."
"Oh my god, that's my biggest fear."
He did something to me that was so perverse.
"Ok, I'm just gonna say it."
He tried to hold my hand.
You mean to tell me that Smith is a hand holder?
And to think he once served us food.
"You laugh, but it's part of a bigger problem."
Do you know I didn't fuck a single or a married guy
the whole time Smith was out of town.
And I'll tell you something else.
"Well, it sounds to me like he missed you too."
"Like it or not, that little tadpole is wide open in there for you."
you might wanna consider holding his hand.
When I visited Big at the hospital.
I finally figured out that the only way to have Big in my life was to
"block oput certain feelings, and now"
every feeling that I've ever had is bubbling up all over the place
with nowhere to go except my eye balls.
"So, what are you gonna do about it?"
He's limited and I acept that.
"So, he'll go back to Napa, and I'll go back to not crying."
"Honey, if it hurts so much, why are we going shopping?"
"I have a broken toe, not a broken spirit."
"If New York City's signature fruit is the apple,"
then its signature sound is the ambulance siren.
"It seems like all day, every day people are getting hurt."
And the whole city has to hear about it.
But what about the injuries that don't get a siren.
Whether you're falling into the hole in the street
or possibly falling back in love.
Just how dangerous is an open heart?
"Hi, can I please be connected to room"
That patient left the hospital this morning.
"When you weren't at the morgue,"
"I figured you were at the Four Seasons, and here you are."
"You know I'd invite you in, Sniffles."
but I've run out of Kleenex.
Should I call the concierge or did you bring your own?
You must have me confused with someone else.
Are you trying to kill me?
"I can't smoke, I can't drink,"
because I love a cute candy stripper.
"This isn't about stripping, it's about striping."
"Um, it's a complete waste of hotel room if you ask me."
What are we gonna do now?
"Oh, Candy's got a whole bag full of PG fun in here."
"Why don't you just take off your dress and kill me now, get it over with?"
Nobody wins with that kind of attitude.
"Steve might have gotten knocked out the other night,"
but Miranda had no idea his girlfriend was a knock out.
You really came down hard there.
Cuz I saw you go flying there.
Robert is just over protective because he's a doctor.
"Debby works for Mastercard, corporate headquarters."
You know Steve won't even let me talk on the phone
when there's a Knicks game on.
Even if I'm in the other room.
I didn't know you were a Knicks man.
"Yeah, I follow all the New York teams."
"One time he took me to a game, and our seats were so high up."
What do they call that section?
I can usually scrounge up a few courtside seats if you're ever interested.
"As Miranda and Steve continued needling each other on the playground,"
Dr. Mao was busy needling Charlotte in his office.
"And this time, she was determined to drown out the voices in her head."
I'll be back in about twenty minutes.
Just try to relax and find your center.
"Unfortunately, she couldn't drown out the voices on the street."
"When Charlotte opened her mind to Chinese medicine,"
she didn't expect a visit from the Cuban Liberation Front.
"Cuz i'm trying to relax and find my center,"
but I just can't do that with all these noise.
the city will never quiet down.
You're gonna have to learn to block out that New York noise
Charlotte was beginning to think that the solution to her problem
"The actors are cool, location was great."
whole thing was off the hook.
"Look, I know where you want to put your hand"
"and I'm sorry, but I'm just not that kind of girl."
And I've had enough with this horseshit.
but only until my foot heals.
And that's how Samantha lost her virginity to Smith.
you've had too many on that end and they're crooked.
"Hey, I'm doing all the heavylifting here, you're sitting there like a log."
And they're too closely spaced together.
"See, you don't understand the delicate balance of physics involved in this."
"Well, that's true, This is really more your generation's game,"
whereas I came of age in the parcheesi era.
"So I guess this is what we'd be like in our seventies, huh?"
"Oh, you're already thinking about your next birthday?"
"Yes, save me a baked potato, I'll meet you there."
"Oh my god, you're burning up."
"Here come on, let's get you in bed."
"So, I'll just keep doing what I'm doing."
"Ok, thank you so much, doctor."
"Well, he thinks you're gonna be fine."
Is this wash cloth still cold?
"You're an angel, you know that?"
"Nah, I'm just doing my job."
"It took the best heart surgeon in New York,"
but Big's heart was finally unblocked.
"In fact, it was wide open."
"The next morning by the light of day,"
both injured parties were rebounding nicely.
A little cranky when he woke up.
that was funny the other day.
"Wait, did you say it was fun or funny?"
But I guess I meant fun.
"Yeah, He seems like a really good guy."
I keep telling people that Debbie punched me.
Heather Greason told me she saw you at Dr. Mao's.
"You feel like a pin cushion, I know,"
but can't you feel it working?
"Well, do you know Isabelle Reed?"
But she's got a great story.
"she tried everything, and I mean everything before she went to Dr. Mao's."
"Anyway, she started going four times a week, taking the herbs."
You have to take the herbs.
It turned out that Dr. Mao was a miracle worker.
"Because in just two short sessions,"
he taught Charlotte to block out all the New York noise she didn't need to hear.
How long have you been up?
It was a shift imperceptible to anyone but me.
But I knew Big's heart had closed again.
"Maybe it would reopen in another five years, maybe it wouldn't."
But I knew myself well enough to know that that's not enough.
Just get me some cornflakes and juice.
"For the first time all week,"
"When Charlotte and I heard that there was a woman in Chelsea not talking or eating,"
We were there in a New York minute.
And she's doing this for how long?
"By changing my personal energy field,"
I'm attempting to change the energy field in this room
and perhaps that energy shift will shift the energy of the world.
"When I was working in the galleries,"
performance art was more theatre then instillation.
She's moved it to the next level.
Well girlfriend needs to move a comb through her hair.
There's a man over there staring at me.
Can you tell Circe that Charlotte from Hisgallerian Spring Street sends her very best?
I don't mean to bother you but..
I just have to say thank you.
"When I first moved to New York and working in the galleries,"
your Abstract was my first important sale.
I mean you defined the in terms of progressive..
And what did you think about this work today?
But you thought it was funny.
There are depressed women all over New York doing the exact same thing as her
"I mean, if you put a phone up on that platform,"
it's just a typical Friday night waiting for some guy to call.
"And frankly, I don't buy the whole hours not eating thing."
"I bet if anyone bothered to come down here three in the morning,"
she wouldn't even be up there.
She'd be around the corner having a Big Mac.
Why do you think she has the life ladders?
To keep her from running out for a snack.
"I just got married so.. can I just say, again,"
"how very, very important your work is?"
That night over at new couple central.
"Hot pizza and in less than minutes, I think I missed my calling."
You just pass by me without a kiss?
I wanted to wait until I can use my hands.
What's with that little pizza box?
"One is a pizza, the other is a surprise for you after the pizza."
One of my guys busted his knee.
I have to go to the hospital.
What are pro basketball players doing on a skateboard?
The sweetest words you can ever say.
In the sweetest way you can ever say them.
Turns out Miranda didn't like surprises as much as she thought.
Last night Robert said I love you.
"He brought it over, I guess as a surprise."
But before we got to it he had to leave
and then I panicked and ate the entire thing.
"If it wasn't there, I wouldn't have to deal with it."
Now was it the fact that he said it on a cookie or that he said it period?
I didn't wanna be the one to have to tell you this about him
If your best friend can't tell you who will?
You should see how cute he is helping plan Brady's birthday party.
And yet I haven't aged a day.
"Just us, some of Steve's family."
I'm not coming if there's a clown.
I need glasses and I am not ashamed.
I have a sexy young man who loves to fuck me and I'm fabulous.
Have you considered putting that on a t shirt?
Are those the kind you get at the drugstore next to the Bengay?
Have you ever heard of that artist Alexander Patrovski?
He was the number one hot guy at Studio
Dated every top super model in the .
oh my nipple's getting hard just thinking about him.
We met at a gallery and he was odd.
"Studio was 'so that would make him, what?"
I just heard from the doctor.
We don't know if it's the acupuncture or all of the herbs that I've been taking
or maybe Harry and I are just a better fitter whatever but I am.
Everything is exactly like it always is..
This is Alexander Patrovski calling for Carrie Bradshaw.
I hope you don't mind me calling you.
I got this number from the friend of yours
who knows the girl who works at the gallery at Circe.
Are you still laughing out that artist?
Saying that she eats all night.
"So, let's go see her at three a. m. to be sure,"
You're the one who's not serious.
You're expecting me to get out of bed
and go meet you at some art gallery at am?
a. m. at a mysterious place?
"I'm not going to get sold into White slavery, am I?"
I don't know what this means.
It just.. you know... went away.
Doctor says it happens all the time.
She's just been sort of sitting and staring since this morning.
She didn't want me to call anybody but I thought..
"No, you did the right thing."
I told her you were coming.
The doctor said the good news is we got pregnant.
He said lots of woman miscarry and go on to have perfectly healthy kids.
Shall I get you some mint tea?
I can't go to Brady's party on Saturday.
"Now on Saturday, all Steve has to do is bring the cake."
Well you haven't mentioned anything about the cookie.
If you give me a minute.
Loved you since I first saw you.
Feel so right to finally say it.
Don't have to hold the words back anymore.
Okay we need to divide and conquer.
I can't say I love you.
"And everywhere I look, it is just flying out of people's mouths."
Who's mouths is it flying out of?
He said it on a cookie
Robert asked about the cookie and it was the perfect time to say it and I couldn't.
He was just hanging there waiting and I couldn't.
I am never gonna be happy.
Just not gonna happen for me.
How can I love him if I can't even say the words?
I always thought that when the right guy came along all of my bullshit will calm down
and go away and the words would just fall out of my mouth
because I would know he was the one.
Because I am so fucked up.
And I am gonna ruin my life.
It's too late to ruin your life.
The only thing you're gonna ruin tonight is your night and mine.
Get a good night sleep see how you feel tomorrow.
Turn off Jules and Mimi and go to bed.
You've seen enough love for one night.
You know what used to make me feel better?
Hundreds upon hundreds of cards all decreeing you're the one.
Just imagine the hundreds and hundreds of wrenching late night phone calls
And it's not just with love.
It seems we're always looking for that one thing to make our lives complete.
"That job, that chance, that family."
when will waiting for the one be done?
Samantha was never a woman who looked for the one
She figured a box in the hand was better than one in the bush.
"Turns out, left on too long, nice and simple was not so nice."
I got my grandson a clown.
He can open the door or something.
Put that cake somewhere cool where it won't get knocked over.
And tell the clown to open the door.
I hope you're not insulted I brought my own beer.
Oh Miranda the baby looks so cute.
She says she wasn't strong enough to come.
I don't know what to do.
She just has to feel it.
This is the story of Elizabeth Taylor.
We'll give you an exclusive revealing look
at one of Hollywood's greatest treasures.
"A talented and courageous woman who was above all, a survivor."
I was told there'd be no clowns.
I need to talk to you in private.
All right well you'll have to wait till I get something to eat.
What is so important that it couldn't wait.
What am I going to do?
It's all part of getting older.
"My eyes getting old is one thing but this,"
Smith is well aware of the fact that you're older.
Older not old and this is old.
No man wants to fuck grandma's pussy.
This is a child's birthday party.
"I was going to tweeze but if you pluck it,"
six more will come to its funeral.
I'm not telling you the whole story.
"And I left it on too long,"
You have ten seconds and then I'm leaving.
I'm going to have to explain why it's red.
"Carrie, I don't think you get the magnitude of this."
"Turns out, there is something scarier than a clown."
Hovering near death for three days.
Elizabeth Taylor's story is an epic.
Now is the time for guts and guile.
This is the story of one of Hollywood's
I'm real glad everything worked out.
I got my pipes all warmed up to sing.
Wait till you see what I got here.
"I'm sorry, I should never have said that."
I love you and I fucked everything up
Will you look at the candle that Steve brought?
"Three weeks later, Miranda and Steve got their wish."
From a one year old's birthday party
to a one a. m. dinner party.
I'm here to meet Alexander Patrovski.
How do you ever know your time?
I find that someone will always tell me.
They said that it's what's expected of Russia.
More red and veal in aspic.
Kind of a meet jell o?
Do you always eat this late at night?
I have a bit of an art question.
I write a column for a newspaper.
"In that case, I'll have a vodka martini please."
this is the latest I've been up in quite a while.
I even had to take a little disco nap.
My spies tell me you were quite the regular at Studio
That must have been an amazing time.
Why don't you tell me about that?
"Martha Graham's face, Andy Warhol's wig."
I rarely think about the past.
"What I care about is... what will happen today, tonight."
I have something to show you and I don't want you to freak out.
I know you enjoy a full bush.
But there's something I should tell you.
There is one moment in every relationship
where you risk letting someone know the real you.
I'm a working woman and I don't have time for you to be down there searching for it.
I wanted to make everything nice and simple.
How long have you lived in New York?
There's no big smile on its face.
You get a girl out of bed to tell her you like pain?
We sweeten out tea with black cherries.
I'm not really a fruit person.
Put it in your purse for breakfast.
Is that a banana in your purse
or are you just very happy to see me?
At exactly we pulled up in front of the gallery to see if Art was alive and awake.
I left it in the cab.
Do you wanna give her a banana?
"Of all my odd dates, this was number one."
I asked him to wait so.. we can have a proper good night.
I thought you lived way downtown.
Well you can take the boy out of Studio
but you can't take Studioout of the boy.
And he tasted like black cherries.
A single gal spends most of her life searching for the perfect male.
"And out of the blue, it arrives."
Aleksandr Petrovsky was a rather famous artist with whom I had
I thought you died or something.
How could you have left me on the street all alone.
And where did you get this information?
I was in Holland for work.
"To the land of the wooden shoes, no."
I brought you a little present.
"You don't have a mouse trap in there, do you?"
"You know, in the cartoons, when they put their hands and the thing.."
"Second only to the search of the perfect male,"
is the search for the perfect fragrance.
He is worldly and wise and very sexy.
Yesterday I almost did it with him on a park bench in front of children.
"Well, that and the fact that I'm not lover ready."
I need a little bikini waxage.
Don't play hard to get with a man who's hard to get.
Why would you wanna smell like a salad?
I can't decide what I am.
Charlotte e mailed me his photo.
"He is in his lover perfect, early fifties."
"They've been around the block, they know how to use their cock."
And where did you get his picture?
I wanted Miranda to see your potential new boyfriend.
How long are you going to keep saying in like that?
Uncomfortable with my taking a lover?
Maybe he cold be more than a lover.
"Ah, no, the only place this is going is Loverville."
"Well, I could see it going somewhere."
"Oh, please, half the time, I can't even understand him."
He's in and out of Europe.
She only wants him to be in and out of her.
"Yes, but in a much less obvious sounding way."
"No, you need something classic, clean."
But just a hint of neurosis.
I'm trying to figure out what Steve might like.
Just get some old spice and call it a day.
Steve does not wear old spice.
He wears nothing and he smells great.
"Oh, Miranda and Steve sitting in a tree K.I.S.S.I.N.G, first comes.."
Now I have to spend the rest of the day smelling like..
Aren't you going to get something for your new lover?
I suspect he already likes the way I smell.
"If Miranda and Steve had a fragrance,"
"If Miranda, Steve, and Robert, her ex and neighbor"
"had a fragrance, it wold be called Less Than Perfection."
"In fact, Awful, Uncomfortable, and Terrible."
"Well, if it isn't the happy couple."
So the doctor said that Harry and I have to wait at least two months before
we even get try to get pregnant again.
"And I like to back to work, but then if I do get pregnant, that's not really fair to the new"
"sleeping and walking, how am I doing that?"
"I know it's important to you, you know it's important to you,"
the homeless guy on the corner of h and h knows it's important to you.
Could we please talk about something else?
I'll give a hundred dollars if you say something bitchy about someone we know.
I'm trying to figure out my next direction and I need to talk about it.
"Fine, Talk to my ears bleed."
But do yourself a favor and stop for a minute and look at the light.
"You mean the fact that no matter what happens with the baby, Harry and I will always have each other?"
"No, Char, the frigging light over there in the park."
Somewhere between your ovaries and my boredom.
"Being blind, not being able to see a beautiful day like today."
Can you think of anything worse?
Stone washed jeans with a matching jacket.
Maybe I should stop thnking so much about myself and volunteer for the blind or something.
That would be a nice thing to do.
Can I ask you a question?
"Yes, it will hurt a little."
"Yes, I was wondering how do you say hello in Russian?"
"And uh, how do you say thank you?"
"The only thing more uncomfortable than a bikini wax,"
is an elevator ride with an ex.
"Luckily, Miranda had figured out a way to avoid that."
"Ok, I guess I deserve that."
I've never meant to hurt you.
Steve and I just fell back in love.
And so what was I to you?
I never thought that Steve and I would
"get back together, or I never would have started up with you."
And I hope you understand when you get my bill.
"You're a busy working mother, too tired to go out and eat,"
"Hoonen Kitchen, too tired to go out and fuck, call Robert."
You were not a fast fuck.
Just the way you liked it.
No man has ever been in this deep.
I gave Robert custody of the elevator.
We're moving my stuff in here next week and you gave him the elevator?
You're lucky I didn't give him Brady.
I bumped into him on the stairs.
So we can't ever use the elevator?
Not between a. m. and p. m.
We have a baby in a stroller.
"Why, why, why did I have to shit where I eat?"
"Look, he's just upset, it'll blow over."
"The man is crazy in love with me and now he's acting out, talking about how"
I said no man's ever been in me that deep.
I took the express elevator to Loverville.
"Oh, you speak Russian very well."
Is that the only word you know?
"Yes, but is that the only word you know?"
"There is my studio, and here's my house."
"Not at first, but over the years."
"This used to be some kind of sewing factory, sweat shop in ."
"Very nice, if you like that whole window sky thing."
"Yes, it's lovely light in the morning."
Would you like some fruit or martini or something?
Why don't you show me upstairs?
"My Russian may have been shaky,"
but I discovered I spoke lover very well.
"Turns out, I'd found a sweet bed and breafast in Loverville."
"In the light of day, everything looked completely different."
Regular coffee is for regular people.
I hope I'm not in the way.
Without them out I'd be sitting in the street with the sign
"But you, Aren't you gonna eat?"
"Maybe before I leave, I'll have one more little bite."
La voiture ne va pas attendre pour toujours.
"Oui, oui, je pars toute de suite."
"Maintenant, sois poli avec M. Groge."
There I was having pancakes at IHOP
And they just went on about their business totally unfazed.
"Oh, honey, they've seen it all."
"And you gotta give it to him,"
You don't think you're the first babe he buttered up for.
"No, he knew exactly what he was doing."
I miss a man with the moves.
"No, he has them, most of them I've given him, but he has them."
"You've got yourself a man, a real powerplayer."
"Someone who takes charge, drags you to the bed,"
"has his way with you, doesn't have to ask what you want,"
and fucks you and fucks you.
"We're not talking about me anymore, are we?"
"No, I mean, Smith, he's hot but he's a baby."
"Still, I swear sometimes I don't know whether to blow him or burp him."
"Delicious, exactly what I wanted, I couldn't get enough."
"No, I was referring to the moves."
"Oh, delicious, exactly what I wanted, I couldn't get enough."
"So, how many pancakes do you think that kitchen has seen?"
"In the cold, harsh reality of daylight,"
"But in the colder, harsher reality of a woman"
"who just slept with someone she likes, it did."
Google dot com showed many many listings
"on the art of Aleksandr Petrovsky, and one"
"According to certain scientists, whenever a woman"
"has sex, her body produces a chemical which"
This chemical may also account for the series of
terrifying questions that involuntarily pop into
our minds after just one casual tryst.
"Questions like does he like me, will he call again,"
"and the classic, where is this all going?"
"When it comes to the men, even when we try to"
"keep it light, how do we wind up in the dark?"
"Hey, I've got this invite to a party Teen Posse's throwing."
"Well, my agent and my manager really want me to go."
At least look at the invite and tell me how lame it is.
The party may have been all wrong but it was being hosted by Richard.
Richard is a big name in the hotel business.
And it was exactly the certain something that Samantha was missing.
"In fact, I'll go with you."
And I'm not relly allowed to try and pregnant again for another two months.
And I thought I have all this time on my hands to volunteer.
"Ok, working as a guide for visually impaired person is a serious undertaking."
We suggest allour potential volunteers go to a public place like a park or a department store
with a friend and let him or her lead your around blindfolded.
"Yeah, try not to take the blindfold off no matter how uncomfortable you feel"
and you'll begin to get a sense of what it's like not to be able to rely on your sight.
I mean where can this possibly go?
I thought you didn't want it to go anywhere.
"Well, that was before I slept with him, now, not so sure."
"No, ridiculous, and according to my new best friend google dot com,.."
"The man has dated every woman in New York from until, well, until last Wednesday."
And who knows how many pancakes he's making for other ridiculous women around the world.
"Oh god, listen to me, and I've only slept with him once."
"So once I put this over my eyes, I can't take it off."
I need you to guide me.
"No, thinking you can take a lover is embarrassing."
"Oh, that's European code, it's him."
"I can, I can't hear you."
"Oh you know what, I need better reception."
I'm gonna go right over there.
Would like the sample in the air?
I'm trying to help the blind.
"I just got separated from my friend, but I'm sure she'll find me."
"And there in the dark, Charlotte realized"
she had no idea where she was going in
"but sometimes, even if you're not sure of your"
"direction, you can find your way to something wonderful."
Don't they have these over there in the..
I swear I looked and looked and then I thought best if she finds me.
"I'm meeting him tomorrow, cute, huh?"
"Let's just go in front of the line, like I suggested."
I don't like pushing in front of people.
Let me just check you off.
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
"Let's get some drinks, shall we?"
"So, how long have you been babysitting?"
Said the man who's hosting a Teen Posse party.
The hotels have to stay hip.
So I have to bend over backwards.
"That's 'cause I'm looking at you, gorgeous."
Can I get you a scotch?
"No thank, man, I'm an AA."
So how do you two know each other?
And then I fucked it up royally and lost the best thing I ever had.
"Oh my god, Smith, you have to come."
Paulie is snorting pretzel out of his nose.
Paulie is snorting pretzels out his nose.
"Okay, this is the last load."
"For a guy with no stuff, you've got stuff."
That wasn't like that when we moved it in here.
"Um hello, he's mad, your name is on the boxes,"
"Nah, it doesn't seem like him, I musta bumped it or something."
"Steve, he's crazy in love with me."
You didn't see how angry he was on the stairs.
I'm not gonna live like this.
I'm gonna take care of things.
He's still in love with me.
"Look, I need to talk to you about this whole Miranda thing."
Turns out Petrovsky wasn't the only one with the international house.
Let's just put it this way.
He won't be bothering us again.
Steve thought it was kinder to leave Miranda in the dark.
"Hey, where are you going, babe?"
Richard wanted to show me one of his remodelled suites.
"Look, this was fun, but where is it going?"
You go play with your friends and I'll go play woth mine.
"Two years ago, I was on top of the fucking world."
Now I'm hosting a bullshit beer bash for a bunch of pinheads with six pack abs.
This is a world class hotel.
I've been down this low before.
"Richard may have, but Samantha haven't."
I just wanted to make sure you got home safe.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I hate myself for doing this to you.
Let's get you out of here.
"Even in the dark, Smith could still see Samantha."
"And for the very first time, she saw him."
"I have some work to do in my studio,"
"but you're welcome to stay, ok?"
It was at that moment I realized I wasn't really comfortable in Loverville.
I'm not that kind of google.
I just wanted to say thank you.
"Ok, then I'll call you tomorrow, all right?"
This has been really lovely but I don't think I'm cut out for it.
"The pancakes and the other ladies,"
There are pancakes but no other ladies.
"Well, I have a book with a few emergency telephone numbers, yes."
But now I just see you.
"This is not about great bang, this.."
"In autumn, New Yorkers treat every nice day as if it could be their last."
You said to meet you at the subway.
I was at the foot of the stairs.
Oh you don't know how to give directions
It's gonna be us in thirty years.
"So for the future, I don't wanna become that."
I don't want you to worry about becoming that.
I don't want you paying for these beers.
I don't wanna become your mother.
I don't wanna slack off like I used to.
I don't wanna be so moody.
I don't wanna lose you again.
"Even if I screw up all the other stuff, that's the one that matters."
I don't wanna lose you either.
Some couples have to say their I don'ts before they can ever imagine saying their I dos.
I was enjoying a different kind of happy hour at Aleksandr Patrovsky's.
It's a little tune I've made up for you.
La femme avec les yeux lumineux.
"Which means a woman with a luminous, shining, sparkling eyes."
That is the cheesiest thing I have ever heard in my life.
I can't even look at you all right now.
It all sounds very old world to me.
Yes and I live in New York City Circa now.
I think it's romantic if someone offers me a sit on the subway.
We are just starved for real romance and that is the sad truth.
Smith is in LA for the week
and he calls me every night before he goes to sleep.
I'm drinking a glass of wine while we do it.
I wanna hear more about the romance.
"There was one more thing but if you I tell you,"
it will be the ick heard around the world.
You know the song that he wrote for me?
La femme avec les yeux lumineux.
The woman with eyes that Sparkle?
"And I swear to you while he was playing it, I floated up out of my body"
and I was on the ceiling looking down at myself thinking
He was just expressing genuine emotion in an old fashioned way.
I can't stand all that artificial hoo hah.
That's why I proposed to Steve over beers.
I'm not doing the big circus wedding.
There will be no white dress or bridesmaids or posed pictures.
Every bride has to find her own style.
Soon as I can find some place that doesn't make me hurl.
"It's just gonna be a simple, nothing thing."
I don't even care about the wedding.
I just wanna be with Steve.
This is exactly what I don't want.
"Samantha, I expected more from you."
He just felt inspired to write her a song and then he played it for her.
Isn't that the most romantic thing you've ever heard?
I used to play clarinet when I was little.
Doesn't that taste like real butter pecan?
"If that's what we're playing, sure."
I can pretend it's whipped flavored air's the real thing.
I mean it's something out of the Victorian novel.
People just don't do those things anymore.
"Hey I can be romantic too, you know."
Oh honey I know you can.
I think it's romantic that you walk me to the Tasti Eelight every night.
I know how to do romance right.
It's not just for foo foo foreigners.
"In fact, I am gonna take you out for a real romantic night on the town."
Let me get another lick of that.
I don't wanna make a big entrance.
I don't want everyone staring at me.
I just wanted to be like us.
not like one of those millions cookie cutter weddings I had to suffer through.
What about one of those boat rides that goes all around the island?
"When have we ever been on a boat together, ever?"
This gum is like super glue.
"We're bad people, not boat people."
We should get married right here in this mess.
We're gonna have to if I can't get this gum off.
The only thing harder than choosing a spot for a wedding when you hate weddings
Is choosing a wedding gift for a friend who hates weddings.
"Sweetie, there's gonna be like of us there."
There's no one to keep track of.
Let's try not to piss her off.
Well maybe we should just buy her a stapler and wrap it in brown paper
and just smear just dog poo on it.
You think she'd be comfortable with that?
I have something to tell you.
And you're not going to like it.
"If you get married and leave me all alone, I will kill you."
As you know I have always loved my body just the way it is.
"My legs are fantastic, I have killer abs."
Is this the part we're not gonna like?
But I have decided after careful consideration
that I might be ready for bigger boobs.
Since I had a cold hard dose of reality.
And that's your source of reality?
They named Smith Jarred the number one hot guy to watch.
They followed him all over town for a week.
There are my boobs on Wednesday.
There they are again on Thursday.
And there they are having lunch.
I should have bought my loop.
I can't believe you would actually consider having a boob job.
I can't believe you went to Planet Hollywood.
You are a confident intelligent woman.
Why would you wanna look like a bimbo.
I wouldn't be getting the watermelon freak show kind.
A few days later the rain came.
Listen if you like this poem.
So long had life together been that once the snow began to fall
that leads to flakes should make her eye lids wince.
I chilled them with my hand and
they pretending not to believe that cherishing of eyes would beat
How about I read you a little bit of my favorite poetry?
Cocktails at Tiffany's calls for classic charm.
Oscar De la renta sleeveless silk five.
Full skirted dress with black patented leather bow belt.
Oscar's a good friend of mine.
I'll tell him you like the dress.
So you feel uncomfortable with the poetry.
Perhaps we were not properly introduced.
I write a column based on the assumption that romance is either dead or just phony.
I'm the one that feels like a phony.
"Frankly, I'm just not used to these grand gestures."
"You mean no other man, no one write you a little poem"
or played a little music for you?
Shopping for my wedding dress on my lunch hour.
"I said no white, no ivory."
Yesterday the Russian read me a Russian poem.
Are you just making this stuff up now?
And this might sound crazy but I don't think it's an act.
I think he actually means it.
I think you should tell him this whole romance thing gives you the icks.
"Turns your stomach and that he's dating you, not Anna Karenina."
And let me ask you something.
why are you having a wedding at all?
Why not just go down to city hall
"You know, I thought about that."
But then I realized I actually do wanna say those vows out loud to Steve
in front of the people I care about.
"My god Miranda, you're my cynical touchstone."
Do you promise to still be cynical even after you're married?
There's a big pile of tutus coming at me.
We need to have another talk.
One of the great things about living in New York City
is that you don't have to sugar coat your feelings.
But have New York women settled for a sugar free existence as well?
We accept Tasti Delight instead of real ice cream.
E mails instead of love songs.
"It's no wonder that faced with the real thing,"
Is it something we could learn to digest or
"Et puis pour la troisieme course, we would like the foie gras,"
followed by the boeuf bourgignon avec la legume a la creme.
it was Harry's version of a serenade.
And Charlotte ate it right up.
"Et en fin, le plat du fromage."
We have a lovely cheese cart.
I had no idea you could speak French so well honey.
The French learn romance from me baby.
"Downtown, in the name of boob job research,"
Samantha decided to go where the biggest crop will be on display.
Okay that's my wife right there.
And then there were the two biggest boobs of all.
You either have the most naturally beautiful breasts I've ever seen
or I need the name of your doctor.
They paid for themselves in tips alone.
"Meanwhile, back in the h century,"
Actually there's an opening at the Met tonight.
"Man, I was this close to throwing on my ball gown but I ignored my instincts."
"All right, I'll go home and change."
"Tonight only your poetry, not mine."
"If I had been on a romance free diet, this seemed like a good time to binge."
"That was the most romantic, elegant."
Are you gonna be long in there?
I'll go to the other one.
"When you splurge on romantic course meal,"
you generally want to remember every bite.
"There was the soup course, the dessert course,"
and all the other yummy courses in between.
Harry and Charlotte had romance shooting out of them every minutes.
For the rest of the night.
Wouldn't go in there if I were you.
I can't make it to the other one.
Surviving a night of food poisoning together wasn't the stuff of great romance
but it was the stuff of lasting love.
"Meanwhile, a funny thing happened on the way to the opera."
It was the most romantic moment.
You gotta take it down a nudge.
And then a quarter a pound of cheese.
Would you like to super size that?
May I offer you a fry?
I think I might be up for a quick spin now.
"And there beneath the florescent moonlight,"
I was finally laughing with romance and not at it.
"And if I went any bigger than this,"
"I think I'd look ridiculous, don't you?"
And hers right before the golden globes.
I have an event in two months that I'd really like to have a little cleavage for.
Will they be up and running by then?
"Ms Jones, you have a little lump I'd like you to have checked out before we begin our work."
"It's right here, you can feel it yourself."
"Well, it's probably just a cyst but we wanna be absolutely sure."
"I'd like you to have it looked out, as soon as possible, okay?"
"By Miranda's wedding day, I felt the whole world have gone romantic"
when Samantha insisted on picking me up in a cab.
This is a hundred block out of your way.
Now we're going to h and h avenue please.
So I had my breast consultation with a plastic sergeant.
Please tell me you've changed your mind.
"And I had it biopsy ed, and it turns out I have cancer."
Well I had it biopsy ed on Wednesday and I found out yesterday.
I'm going to give you all the information and I don't want you to get upset
or start worrying and the only reason I'm telling you now and not later
is I didn't want to accidentally blurt out
I have cancer' in the middle of Miranda's wedding.
And please don't tell Charlotte and Miranda.
I don't want to ruin their days too.
Just that there are cancer cells and I had a monogram and they think
it's small which is a good sign.
And I won't know anything else until they take the fucker out next week.
"So there, now you know everything and we can talk about something else."
So do you like my skunk?
"Well, thank you for telling me."
I'm sorry to put a big cloud over the whole day.
I know I'm gonna be fine.
I don't wanna lose my breasts.
To love and to cherish for as long we both shall live.
To love and to cherish for as long we both shall live.
"Look, mommy and daddy are getting married."
", In sickness and in health,"
To love and to cherish as long as we both shall live.
To love and to cherish as long as we both shall live.
Do you promise to uphold these vows
you've made here today witnessed by your closest friends and family?
"With the power invested in me by the State of New York,"
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
"Come on everybody, it's happy time."
The one wedding ritual Miranda never had a problem with was the part
where everyone eats and so we did.
"Samantha, you look so pretty today."
Are you all okay with drinks?
No we're not okay with drinks.
I like the color of your dress.
I admire you for not pretending.
So we're family now and there's something private I wanna tell you.
"The day I married Steve's father,"
"When I walked down that ail at St. Agnus,"
I had a white dress on the outside and my little Jackie on the inside.
I am legally bound to Steve's mother.
"You think I'm an asshole, that I've become one of them."
Then tell me what you were talking about.
I don't wanna ruin your special day.
"Forget about my special fucking day and be normal, please."
It's now my special fucking day.
"Miranda, I expected more from you."
"See, this is what we were afraid of."
You are my people and we'll talk about it now.
You are the bossiest bride in the world.
Yes I am and you have to do everything I say.
we were all ourselves that day.
Just the way Miranda wanted it.
I've been dating the Russian for two months when we hit a relationship benchmarks
so rare I didn't even know it existed.
He gave me his alarm code.
And I had the keys made.
You made me a set of keys?
"I had my assistant go to locksmith, but..."
I'll write it down for you.
It was a kind of security I'd never experienced in a relationship.
Do you really wanna hear about this now?
"Oh, yes, I need the distraction."
Samantha was feeling less secure as we waited for the results of her lumpectomy.
"They got it out, it's going to be fine."
"Oh, ok, well, it was just so easy."
I mean Big made me beg for a key in front of his doorman whereas
the Russian had just welcomed me into his life and his apartment.
Did I mention the extra robe in the bathroom?
Is it as nice as this one?
Even nicer if you can believe it.
"Well, Samantha, I have good news."
"all your scans look clean, and I classify you as stage one."
"Now, because of the nature of your tumor,"
I would still recommend a course of chemo.
I don't understand how this happened to me.
"It could be gentics, but since there's no breast cancer in your family,"
"it could be a variety of factors,"
Some studies have shown women who haven't had children
have an increased chance of getting it.
So I brought this on myself?
"No, I'm just giving you the basic..."
"I'm going to find some woman doctor,"
some hot woman doctor who understands what this is all about.
You're lucky to have touched my breasts.
It was hard to be huffy in a cloth robe but somehow Samantha pulled it off.
"All right then, good to meet you."
"I shouldn't be punished for not having kids,"
Since when did kids become the get out of cancer free card?
He's basically saying that I'm a whore who deserves chemo.
"No, I don't think that's what he was saying."
What I don't understand is if they got it all why do you need chemo?
Evidently there can be something microscopic.
"Excuse me, do you have cancer or Tourette's?"
"I'm getting a new doctor, a woman."
I have heard great things about Dr. Mc..
"Top rated oncologist by New York magazine, four years running."
I gotta get back to the office.
I'm taking a long weekend so I can't take a long lunch.
"Steve wanted to go on a little trip,"
so we're driving up to some mountain lodge tomorrow.
Is this little trip your honeymoon?
"And yet, you just got married last week."
"Well, it's not a real honeymoon if Brady's there."
Then I guess it's a whatever.
What have you got against honeymoons?
"It's basically sex with room service, right?"
You have to have a real honeymoon.
I've already given her the time off.
"She's made plans, she's going to nanny paluza or something."
"I'll take him, I'd love to take him."
"It's four days, adorables tops after a day and a half."
"Well, I could take care of him part of the time."
"I'm his godmother, it's the least I can do."
I can handle him for a couple of days.
You guys would really do that?
I wouldn't because Smith is coming back into town
and I've always chosen sex over babies.
And that's apparently why I got cancer.
"The next day, I tried on two labels."
Now we're gonna go into carriage and we're gonna see the..
I think that I was just mistaken for a mother by a mother.
"Yes, Brady and I are having a lovely time."
"In fact, we are going to spend the afternoon at the Hotel Petrovsky."
"Well, I wouldn't have guessed it but when I told him I had Brady for the day"
he said to bring him over.
"Charlotte, it's death trap, we're just gonna strap a pillow around the kid and hope for the best."
"And further downtown, Samantha was in hot pursuit of the hot woman doctor."
"Hi, I'm Samantha Jones, we've spoke on the phone several times."
"Uh huh, please stay behind the partition."
"Sorry, I know that you said Dr. McAndrew was booked,"
but I was referred here by Dr. Ward and Dr. Pappum
who both attended the Paint for the Cure Benefit I threw.
My good friend Susan Schaeffer who threw the Dance for the Cure Benefit
said that sometimes Dr. McAndrew can squeeze you in if you just show up.
"Well, who do you have to fuck to get chemo around here?"
All of New York is dealing with cancer.
Not to mention some very pushy people in Los Angeles and Miami
I'll just take a seat and hope for an opening.
"No, doctor has no openings till March."
"You know, I've been here since am so"
if anyone's going to get in without an appointment
"Well, I've been waiting for two days and so far no one's gotten in yet."
I was once told I wouldn't be able to get backstage to see Mick Jagger.
"Well, I did get backstage and I blew him."
"Excuse me, I don't know if this is an appropriate question to ask."
I think we passed appropriate a few seconds ago.
What kind of cancer do you have?
"I'm curious, do you have children?"
"No, no, no, I am a nun."
But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy your Mick Jagger story.
I thought that nuns had to wear..
"Oh, I haven't worn a habit in years."
"So then, you don't have sex."
But thanks for getting my mind off cancer for the first time in a week.
"Samantha felt a little better knowing that saints and sinners, despite their habits,"
get the same treatment when it comes to cancer.
"And so far, that was no treatment at all."
He gave us a candy. ?
"Well, my other plan was just to leave and pretend you'd been burgled."
You want the keys back right now?
Aleksandr holding the baby was the most disarming thing of all.
Do you think we should go for a walk or something?
How often do we get to do that?
So do you think we should get dressed?
I plan on being naked for the next four days.
"But hey, there is a CD player and a CD."
I forgot my cell phone charger.
"You're not gonna need your cell phone, it's just you and me."
"As Miranda got a crash course in life as a twosome,"
I got a glimpse of life as a threesome.
This is your best of work yet.
Have you ever thought about having children?
"No, I've always thought that I might,"
"I just, you know, I just haven't gotten around to it yet."
And when are you planning to do this?
I felt like I was just shot with a.
The Russian doesn't want to have kids.
Had one a long time ago.
"Well, then Dosvedanya or however you say it."
"No, for you maybe, but not for me."
Don't you wanna have the option?
But it is my experience that man like him
I've heard I'm running out of time.
I don't even have time to eat this cookie.
It's so good I forgot to have children.
"No, no, I don't think so."
Is he willing to have it reversed?
I don't even know his birthday yet.
"At our age, you have to be able to talk about having children if you think it might get serious."
"That attitude, by the way, that awareness on the part of a woman"
that time is ticking is very sexy to a man.
But you can't be scared to have those talks.
"It is, it's a perfectly scary conversation."
I didn't even wanted to have it with myself.
"It means that if I really wanted to have a baby,"
wouldn't I have tried to have one by now?
"I wantd to be a writer, I made myself a writer."
"I want a ridiculously extravagant pair of shoes,"
I find a way to buy them.
You have been waiting for the right man and the right time.
"Yes, that's exactly the way it goes in my head too."
Maybe I'm not just a baby person.
Why should you give up having a baby for a man who you hardly know?
Why should I give up a man for a baby I hardly know I want?
"I think you're a baby person, you're a closeted baby person."
You didn't even want to leave Brady for two days.
"Well, look at how well you did."
I think you should definitely have a baby.
"All right, I should get home, get some work done."
"Well, then why don't you just keep Brady a little longer till dinner time at least?"
"What, you think I'm gonna decide if I'm a baby person"
in the next couple of hours?
You still have a couple of years.
You know what would be romantic?
"We have a fire, a bubble bath, champagne."
"I know, but I wanna wash it for you."
"You know, like in 'Out of Africa'?"
What could be better than that?
"Good, but that's not why I'm calling."
I'm in the woods in my neglige and my cell phone only has two bars left.
"This whole place, this whole trip is screaming,"
you should be having sex with your husband again.
We've already done it twice today.
It's like sex is the only thing on the itinerary.
So you two are getting along.
"Well, then, don't forget the ice."
"Last night, Steve and I held hands for an hour and a half watching the fire."
"He was looking into my eyes,"
I was looking for the remote.
It feels good to be sarcastic.
You can't be sarcastic on your honeymoon.
"So, this whole motherhood thing, all it's cracked up to be?"
"Ok, there's something in the bushes"
and I hope it's wild animal and not Steve coming to have sex with me again.
"I should be able to do this, Carrie."
This should be the most romantic time of my life.
"After Miranda used the's' word twice,"
I wondered if should was another disease plagueing women.
"Did we want babies and perfect honeymoons,"
or did we think we should have babies and perfect honeymoons?
How do we separate what we could do and what we should do?
"It's not just peer pressure, it seems to be coming from within."
Why are we should ing all over ourselves?
Then there are the shoulds of promoting film
"which Samantha should have been in favor of,"
but she wasn't in the mood.
You should stay at the party.
I did enough parties in L.A.
I'd rather go home with my girl.
I really don't feel like having my photograph taken tonight.
I'm gonna go out first and we'll talk tomorrow.
We haven't spent a night together since I've been back.
You didn't even talk that much last couple of times we had phone sex.
"Smith, when you were in L.A., they found a lump in my breast and it's cancer."
"The next day, at the Hotel vasectomy, I had some questions for the man next to me."
"Her name's Chloe, she's twenty two."
"She lives in Paris, and her mother lives there too."
And you were married to her mother?
"Yes, it's the only time I was married."
"Lasted seven years, five of them good."
This is my little thing at age four. ?
In our little house in Santorini.
I like my life the way I like it.
I got really lucky with Chloe.
"Purple cake, purple dress, purple shoes."
"There it was, wrapped up in a bow."
The whole life that I am never gonna have with him
because he had it already with somebody else.
"And I know I shouldn't say this to someone with cancer,"
"Well, I guess it's not going to happen."
"That life, if I'm with him."
What else is on the menu?
There are a lot of fabulous things in life that don't include a baby.
If that's where this is going.
And at this point I've been only invited in as far as a security code and a robe.
And the question that I need to ask is just..
to make up for the fact that I didn't have a baby.
"Exactly, it's only been two months."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
It's too early in the relationship to have that conversation and...
But it's too late in life not to.
"And after safely putting Brady to bed in his very sturdy crib,"
Charlotte and Harry enjoyed some romance as well.
"Ok, you need to spit it out."
Do we need to come home?
He was looking at me during.
"Charlotte, he doesn't know what he's looking at."
He doesn't know where his nose is.
"Harry, Brady can't be anywhere near this conversation."
I think it may be too late.
He just said sex is dirty.
"you sound tense, maybe I should still come home."
"No, I'm sorry to bother you."
I still have a bar left.
I don't need to come to bed.
"Steve, I can't have sex anymore."
I know you have a brain.
"I love you, but I can't love you this often."
"I can't love you twice a day, everyday."
"I miss ESPN, and NPR, and Dateline."
I am not the honeymoon type.
"But it was my honeymoon, too."
Four days is a long time.
But it's all I have from work.
"Suddenly, Miranda understood the new should in her life."
The things you should do for someone you love.
"That's sweet, and gross at the same time."
"For Miranda, once the honeymoon was over, it could finally begin."
"Hey, I got a brain, you know."
"The next day, at Dr. McAndrew's office,"
"Pulling out all the stops, huh?"
"Well, what else was I gonna wear?"
This is my second day at this f ucacta
office and my good friend features editor at Vanity Fair..
"Ms. Jones, I told a thousand times."
"Well, yes, I suppose I am."
It was the one name Samantha hadn't dropped.
"He's a very loyal boyfriend, always by my side."
He would probably come here with me if I had an appointment.
"Sometimes, I make an appointment at o'clock."
"She doesn't like it, but she'll do it."
"And Smith, does he get up that early?"
"For this, I think we would."
"Oh, and um, if you could get her an appointment,"
he might kiss you on the lips.
Smith turned out to be more than a screensaver.
And that is how Smith got Samantha in plus nun.
I know you may think it's way too early to saywhat I'm about to say but...
I could really be with you
and I just wanna say that...
"if this is something you are thinking,"
I'm as you said and so..
It depends who you're talking to.
"So here we are, so soon."
I could really be with you as well.
"But believe me, I know who I am and I won't change my mind."
I'm simply too old for that.
Being a parent is an extraordinary thing.
I wouldn't want you to miss that
And you should have everything you want.
"I didn't know what exactly I wanted,"
but I felt like I was getting warmer.
"When you're dating someone new, everything can seem foreign."
Especially when you're dating someone foreign.
My Russian had been taking me around the world.
"Greece in Astoria, Italy in the Bronx."
"Tonight, it was Korea; on W.d St."
"So, should we get a cab?"
I've not been to this mysterious place before.
But I believe we can walk.
Have never made the risotto in frying pan before.
"And I don't usually make my guests sit on the floor next to my stack of Vogues,"
which I ordinarily hide in the tub for company.
I don't have an espresso machine.
"And you call yourself a writer, yeah?"
"I may have an old Mr. Coffee One Cup but,"
You don't want this in your house.
Well maybe he was just crossing through to get to the much nicer apartment next door.
"Where there's one, there will be more."
At least it didn't happen in a room I actually used like my closet.
"The next morning, we were determined to use our good humors"
to make Samantha's kemo lounge as close as possible to a cocktail lounge.
Look at Miranda working Mr. Grape there.
Well you guys are having a good time.
Are all you as fun as Samantha?
"Samantha I have to say, you are amazing."
"And if you love me in chemo,"
wait till you see me at Smith's movie premiere.
"I'm getting a hot dress, fantastic shoes."
I'm going to kick cancer and that red carpet's ass.
It's not at all what I expected.
They have these barker loungers and videos and Popsicles.
"You throw in Shuffle Board, it'd be a vacation in Miami."
"Later, the Russian took me somewhere else I've never been before."
Had a friend who had breast cancer.
I think this one is you.
From Kitchen supplies to a kitchen surprise.
Thanks for calling on a Saturday.
None of my eggs were viable.
What do you want to do?
I'm gonna go for a run.
"In high school, Charlotte was voted most popular,"
head of the track team and class president.
"Meanwhile, across town a couple who had won the baby race,"
had lost their bedroom to their baby.
Why don't they say what it really is?
"In our price range, three bedroom."
What did I tell you about that side of the paper?
"Steve, we're not moving to Brooklyn."
I don't like anything not Manhattan.
"Hey, I'm Queens and I'm pretty cute."
Sleeping in the dining room isn't so bad.
Did you let Fatty out of the laundry room?
We can hear Brady through the wall.
"Miranda, we can't keep living like this."
No wonder you work all night.
That's the way I like it.
I'm gonna need a little milk in this.
I need to talk to you about something.
You know the other day when I was talking about my friend?
I just felt like you weren't being very sensitive about my feelings.
I mentioned her and your first response was to tell me about your friend.
But my friend is going to be fine.
Maybe I'm not being very clear.
You don't want your friend to die.
"you must acknowledge this possibility, yes?"
They caught it early at Stage 1
and she's having the Cadillac of chemo.
"No, she is going to be fine."
And your scaring me isn't helping.
"All I'm saying when my friend died,"
Okay I don't know why but.. you are not listening to me.
All I've said is... please don't talk about your friend who died.
"you know, I asked you not to mention your friend."
And now all I can think about is your friend
and my friend has nothing to do with your friend
Think you're acting like a child.
And I think you're acting like an asshole.
Maybe you should go for now.
It was my first fight with the Russian
and I didn't know if it was the strong espresso
"or the strong words but either way,"
not even my feet slept that night.
Look at you and your little coat.
That's a mighty name for such a little dog.
"Oh my god, I love dog shows."
She was bred from two champion Cavalier King Charles Spaniels
"but when I tried to show her, it turns out she has a defect."
One of her hind legs is too short.
That was the day a King Charles met an Upper East Side princess.
And an upper east sider went to see a house in Brooklyn.
"Miranda tried to see her future in Brooklyn,"
but she just couldn't get there.
"Apparently, Samantha wasn't the only one losing something that night."
Her hair started falling out at a really bad time.
But she was definitely doing a job.
"But according to my Russian friend, we're all in denial."
"Him: your friend might die, yes?"
"This is a man who is so sensitive about so much but then this death,"
"I know he's Russian, but Jesus, come on."
It's definitely a barrier for me.
A man kills mice and optimism?
You are aware that you've said she'll be fine three times in half a block.
"I just picked up on that, too."
"In any way, how's it helping her if we freak out about it?"
It is our job to think positive.
Can you believe we're actually having this conversation?
And here's another thing I've never thought I'd be saying.
Steve wants us to move to Brooklyn.
that is information I can't handle.
My conversation with Miranda brought me back to reality.
the people who want us to live in it.
The world tells us to get real.
"But what happens when living in reality means living in pain, fear, or Brooklyn."
"If the defense mechanism can get us through the difficult times,"
Maybe the reality is we need denial.
"Denial had become Charlotte's best friend,"
It could be just a backup.
If we put ourselves on some lists.
"By the time we know what's what,"
That seems like the right thing to do.
"Just because somebody doesn't perform the way that you want them to,"
doesn't mean you should just give up on them.
I'm trying to have a baby and it's just not going very well.
"That day, thanks to a dog with one short leg,"
I used to do this when I was at the mall.
I have a movie premiere and I need to look like myself at my most fabulous.
"What would you like, natural hair or acrylic?"
"Sweetheart, does it look like I'd do acrylic?"
These are our best natural hair.
It's from the Riding the Greek Mine.
Florence Henderson in a bad wig.
"Listen, I can't be on the red carpet in a bad rug."
I don't wanna look like Candy.
I just wanna look like myself.
They're not ever gonna look exactly like you.
I've worked with many women with cancer.
And I don't want some second rate wig named after a hooker.
"Sweetie, we'll find you a better wig."
I have left hair all over Manhattan.
"Every time the wind blows, I have to check to make sure I'm not bald."
"Until then, I have to look like a sick person and I don't do sick person."
You're someone had a little blip of bad luck and now it's over.
"Hey, you are not going anywhere."
Let me talk about what I'm afraid of.
The denial part of me wanted to say you'll be fine.
Maybe I should just shave it all off.
You could be one of those fantastic bald women who's all about earrings.
I better not look like fucking Co jack.
"After Samantha lost control, she did the only thing she knew to get it back."
What do you mean you're not coming to my premiere?
"I'm shaving my head, all right?"
And it's scary and awful and you can't handle it.
Who says I can't handle it?
You freaked out after just a few little hairs.
Let me be here for you.
"Listen, this is very intense and you're being very sweet"
but there is no way that you can relate to what I'm going through.
"When I'm done cue balling here,"
I'm moving right over to you.
"That night, Smith gave Samantha the very best head of her life."
"The next day, Miranda endured her first out of Borough experience."
Let me show you what we could do.
"We tear out these closets, we make this the dining room."
Which you wouldn't have to sleep in.
"open up this fireplace, imagine all of our friends over here,"
"fire's going on, having some beers."
None of our friends are coming to Brooklyn but continue.
This isn't just about you anymore.
"Brady's only gonna get bigger, god willing."
You want the all of us.
"To really look at this place,"
I'm gonna take Brady and the dog outside.
You let me know what you think.
Come on let's go out back.
"That day, Miranda couldn't deny what was best for her family."
We're very interested but I'll gonna wanna bring in an engineer.
"I'd require a long escrow, and if the furnace isn't up to code,"
"And so, she negotiated her way into her future."
And Samantha realized she couldn't deny cancer.
She may never be exactly who she was again.
"So for that night, she decided to be Lil' Kim."
It was a very special delivery from Ms. Stork.
You'll give her a better home than I ever could Trudy Stork
Anything that makes you smile like that.
What should we name you pretty girl?
Who's the prettiest girl in the world.
That was the day Elizabeth Taylor moved in with Harry and Charlotte.
And something far less glamorous moved in with me.
He will stay at the fancy neighbors' now huh?
I didn't think I would hear from you.
"you know, I need you to not talk so that I can say this without you confusing me."
She will be fine because she has to be fine.
That's how important she is to me.
"So, for you to say that she may not be just.."
I didn't want you to be surprised like I was.
"Well, you could have just said that."
I need my relationship with a little bit of milk.
"It's clear who's the writer here, huh?"
"That night, for the first time,"
"So while Samantha's life and my life with the Russian would continue,"
"it was clear that Miranda's life as we knew it, was over."
"I can't even say it, let alone live in it."
How long are you gonna play that cancer card?
As long as it takes for you to move back.
But it's just a subway ride away.
"That night, Miranda was determined to drink in as much Manhattan as she could."
Do you remember that awful apartment that I had on h street?
The one with the water box?
What about your horrifying Studio sublet in River Side Drive?
"Man, I have had some really shitty apartments here."
Why do I think living in Manhattan is so fantastic?
It'll be childish of us to deny that our lives weren't changing.
"But for this night, none of us were going anywhere."
That's the thing about really good friends and a really great Manhattan.
And look for ways to generate heat.
"They are cold, and you are warm, so.."
"You're seated at the star table, I see."
There's ten thousand restaurants in New York and everyone's at Pastis.
the most fantastic painter in New York.
"Audra Clark, she's the editor of Artlife magazine."
Handsome Lee has just informed us of your upcoming show in Paris.
"Yeah, right, a solo exhibit at the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume."
You are so full of shit.
"It's your first new exhibit in what, four years?"
"Well, the world is waiting with breath that is baited."
We need menus and a wine list.
Are you an artist as well?
"No, I write a column for a newspaper."
"It's very good column about women, men and sex."
"No, no, what are you... oh.."
It's my belief that the last time anyone actually enjoyed the position was in
That wasn't one of my smartest ones.
"And further Uptown, Charlotte didn't mind the cold."
She had a new puppy love to keep her warm.
"Oh, that is the most precious little thing."
That is the fourth person to stop and gush.
"I swear that dog's getting cruised more than me, and we're on the corner of gay and gay."
"She loves the attention, doesn't she?"
"She was a show dog, you know."
"Well, no, but I think that was only because her last owner wasn't very supportive."
I think she misses the competition.
I'm thinking of re entering her.
"I think with my love and a little encouragement,"
Nobody puts baby in the corner.
"And over in Brooklyn, someone was not feeling so prancy."
I had to walk all the way from the subway in these heels.
Why didn't you just carry and wear sneakers like everyone else?
"You can take me out of Manhattan, but you can't take me out of my shoes."
I have much bigger things to complain about.
Did you get a chance to install my DSL line today?
I was putting up sheet racks in Brady's room.
"Steve, you know I can't live without internet access."
You want your kid to live without walls?
The Pony Express finally got our address right.
"Finally, a connection to the real world."
I can't believe that you read that crap.
"I love it, it's my thing."
"I'm reading this, you no longer exist."
"That night, at the only restaurant that seemed to exist."
He's so unbelievably hot in that Gus Van Sant's movie.
But can he pull off a fuschia Oswald Boateng shirt?
I hear she's a wonderful woman.
"Oh my god, that's a good look for you."
"Well, I decided to turn a little hair loss into a lot of hair game."
Jam in here right next to me.
"Oh, what are you drinking, it looks yummy."
You gotta let me get a picture.
Only if you get my friends here.
I heard that Aleksandr Petrovsky is having a solo show in Paris.
"It's exciting, tell me about your show."
Why would I want to talk about my work
when I have you in bed with me.
"Because I want to know about it, cuz it's important to you."
I just wanna know more about what you do.
"If for no other reason, then I would like to avoid having this face at restaurant."
I prefer keep my work and my private life separate.
"All this art talking, it's so fucking boring."
Then you're an exception to the rule.
"if you're not going to tell me about National Gallery blah blah,"
then I need to get serious about my busy day.
"Stay here, do nothing, get in trouble."
But I'm meeting people for things.
"It's cold out there, stay here where it's warm."
"Samantha, I don't know how to tell you this,"
but I was reading my Tattle Tale and there's a picture of Smith.
"Miranda, what in the world are you doing reading something like that?"
"I love it, it's my thing."
"Oh, Smith is always in that rag."
"Yeah, but this time, he's gay."
"Oh, Boys s s Night Out."
"Smith cozies up to Broadway dancer,"
"Marcus Adant, and unidentified older gay gentleman."
So this makes you his beard.
I'm a beard and a wig.
"Oh, please, after the big C, you don't sweat the small stuff."
"And besides, once the gay rumor starts,"
it means you're really a star.
"Oh, bad news, I don't think I'm gonna make it."
I'm just all the way downtown with the Russian and it's very cold out.
She's still downtown and it's too cold.
"Well, you know, we haven't seen you in forever and"
Elizabeth Taylor is going to be in a dog show.
And Miranda wants to really talk to you.
What do you mean you're not coming?
Don't try to change the subject.
I came in all the way from Brooklyn.
You'd use any excuse to come in the city.
You owe me a trip to Brooklyn.
It's too cold to leave the house.
You stay downtown with your hot man.
Which is exactly what I did.
I finally left the Russian's warm apartment.
And came home to the tropics.
"When you've been spending all your time in your new world,"
it's easy to forget that there might be people trying to reach you
We just put our new cabernet to bed.
"Called your cell, but I think I copied the number wrong."
Unless you're a ticked off guy named Paco.
"Hey, I wanna talk to you, call me."
"Listen, uh, did I do something to tick you off?"
"If I did, call me and I'll apologize."
Did you call him to tell him you deleted him?
What do you think he was calling about?
"And for the first time, don't really care."
"After his last trip, I finally got it."
Things are serious with the Russian.
It's just so different and so..
"There's not a lot of fuss,"
"there's no confusion about how he feels about me, he tells me all the time."
Unlike answering machine up there in Napa.
I was beginning to feel bad about Steve and me.
we don't really have anything in common but each other.
We're not really involved in each other's lives.
He never shares anything about his work.
I don't talk to Steve about my work.
I think he prefers it that way.
But you guys share everything else.
There's no one else to talk to.
"Yeah, I guess I just had this idea about a couple sharing everything."
You want passions on top of passion?
"Oh, I stopped off and picked up some dessert for you ladies."
"Brooklyn's finest, we have cheese cake..."
I'll put these stuff out in the kitchen.
I love having your friends over.
"I want you to meet him, my Russian."
"That log is really heating up the joint, uh?"
It was clear from his silence we weren't having passions on top of passions for breakfast.
"Hey, what are you doing on Sunday night?"
"Well, I was thinking since I met some of your friends the other day,"
maybe you could meet some of my friends.
Those people were my colleagues and not my friends.
My friends are mostly in Europe.
"Then on Sunday, I'll be happy to meet your fantastic friends."
"And FYI, you have a friend in New York, me."
"You're not my friend, you're my lover."
And that is a much better thing.
I have to write my column.
I can't turn it in late again.
"I can't, my computer's at home."
I have a computer very good for writing columns.
You would let me use your fancy computer.
In exchange for one hour in bed.
"They say that opposites attract, but they never say for how long."
Should the relationship savvy person stoke the fires of passion
with the kindling of work and friends
or shold we simply be satisfied with the romance that sizzles?
"Without sharing your worlds, can even the hottest relationship stop cold?"
"Meanwhile, Samantha was about to hear the hottest rumor"
from the city's hottest rumor mail.
Did you see that picture of Smith online?
No one that good looking is ever straight.
I thought he was dating Samantha Jones.
"All this time, I thouhgt she had the hottest sex life in New York city."
Turns out she's just a fag hag.
And here comes the hound group.
"In the blink of a tabloid, I went from Demi to Liza."
These people know who you are.
Marcus got three auditions off that picture.
How can they just assume I'm gay?
"Ok, I've got ten bucks on Lord Reginal the Fourth down there."
"Oh, you are a good friend."
All the way from Brooklyn to see a bunch of dogs run in a circle.
"She came to see my baby get baptized, I came to see her baby get judged."
I almost didn't show my face.
There go years and years of fucking everything that walks.
I thought you weren't gonna sweat the small stuff.
"Look, I can't have cancer and be a fag hag."
"Oh, Hey, you guys want to have drinks with the Russian tomorrow night?"
It's just the girls this time.
"You'd be in the next round, I promise."
"Ok, I gotta go backstage and check on the little mother."
We still got sporting and walking and toy.
This was not the type of blow job I was hoping for today.
Did you see how impressed the host committee was?
I really think she has a chance.
"You know, you think with all these faggy little dogs,"
there'd be at least one horny circuit muscle gay here.
"No, nothing but boxy thick naked ladies and tweety old queens."
Did you cut yourself with the scissors?
There are drops of blood here.
The freaking dog just got her period.
"Oh yeah, Aunt Flo's in doggy town."
I once won a junior gymnastics meet when I had mine.
Run around looking for a teeny tiny tampon?
Elizabeth Taylor just got her period.
I thought she looked a little bloated.
And she was so bitchy earlier.
And here come the toy dogs.
"The judges narrowed it down to the toy poodle,"
"The pomeranian, champion?, and the King Charles spaniel, Elizabeth Taylor."
Charlotte was a dog show natural.
Thanks to her blue blood background.
The judge's examining the dogs' gaits one more time
"It's the King Charles spaniel followed by shitzu,"
"the pomeranian, and the toy poodle."
"but to the judge, Charlotte was the best in show."
"Samantha Jones, I thought that was you."
"Tom, what are you doing here?"
I'm head of the press for this tacky thing.
"Listen, could I get Smith's number?"
I have got to put a stop to this.
And from dog show to doggy show.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
"I need to set the record straight, literally."
But I don't care if people think I'm gay.
"Now, when we get going, make sure to say,"
"Samantha Jones, you are one hot piece of ass."
"I could fuck you all night long, Samantha Jones."
How are you going to get this around?
I know exactly whose hands to drop this into.
"The very next day, two PR girls got an anonymous triple X from FedEx."
"You have to come next time, she was so happy."
You know what would make her happy?
Letting her off that show leash.
"Oh no, I don't thnk so."
Give her a little victory lap on her own.
"Oh look, she made a little friend, isn't that sweet?"
"She's a blue ribbon winner, stop."
Watch out for the big one.
Elizabeth Taylor got gangbanged in the park?
"Oh god, that is so s."
There we were at Asia de Cuba waiting for my lover de Russia.
"Seriously, I could not believe how many dogs she was with."
"It was disgusting, my sweet little girl."
"Well, I think she's a woman now."
"Well, he's not gonna make it."
"No, he's just in the middle of something at his studio,"
If he's feeling inspired then he shouldn't stop.
He's getting ready for this big exhibit at some Paris museum.
I wanted you guys to meet him.
Compliments of Mr. Petrovksy with sincere apologies.
"Hey, you know what, why don't we finish these off,"
crack this open and give him some time and go over there and say hello.
"Oh honey, you sure you want to disturb him?"
"Yeah, yeah, we'll just go say hi."
He's always telling me to be more spontaneous.
A couple cocktails and a bottle champagne later.
"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
I told you I was working.
"I know, but I wanted my friends to meet you."
"But, this is Miranda and Samantha, a. k.a."
And I wanted them to see the house.
"When I say I'm working, I'm workling, ok?"
"I'm sorry guys, I'm very, very busy, but please do stay."
"Enjoy the apartment, we'll meet one day, alright?"
"Oh, do you guys still want to see the apartment?"
I should get back to Brooklyn before Steve thinks I've defected.
Foxy's ready to hang up her wig.
Do you wanna come share a cab with me uptown?
"No, no, I'm think I'm gonna stay."
I am so glad to be home.
I love you for loving my friends.
"And I love you for no walls and cheese cake, cannoli."
"Well, if you love me for that stuff, what's gonna happen now?"
I put in a DSL line.
"And although Steve had satisfied Miranda,"
"Samantha Jones, you're one hot piece of ass."
"I'd fuck you all night long, Samantha Jones."
Samantha's hot tape cooled her love of gossip for good.
"And try as I might, I could not forget the Russian's icy treatment of my friends."
"Hey, I need to talk to you."
"I know that you're busy, but those were my.."
Did something happen with the piece?
"Hey, come on, talk to me."
It's true I don't know anything about the piece but...
The world is waiting with a breath that is baited.
"Ohm, she's just an uptight bitch."
"So talk to me, what's the problem?"
"I may not understand, but I'll listen."
and the entire thing looked so utterly stupid
and flat and needless and childish.
"Sometimes, there's not enough time in a night for both your worlds."
"When you live in New York City,"
it can take all your energy to stay in Vogue.
"So when Enid Figg, my old boss at Vogue wanted to meet me for lunch,"
I was eager to hear what she had for me.
"Carrie, I need to ask you a favor."
"Apparntly, this would be about what I had for her."
"I wanted to invite you to a party that I'm throwing, a week from Saturday."
It's for an amazing couple Roma Patelle and Andre Dubiankie.
"Well, unless I'm doing the catering, it sounds like a fun favor."
There'll be a lot of couples from the art world and...
I thought maybe you could bring your Alexander Patrovski.
I can't believe I have to ask this.
Does he have a single friend that you could bring along for me?
Well the thing is it's shaping up to be mostly couples and...
I'm not a couple and there are no exciting prospects
so I thought that someone from his crowd might be right for me.
Please never mention this conversation to anyone at Conde Naste
This is a much larger fish.
This fish we recommend for two people.
You have to be a couple just to order lunch in this town.
I'll have the dorado as well.
"Because if this is a pity Dorado, I can have crab cakes."
The only thing is I'm not sure if Alexander is a let's set people up kind of guy.
"Carrie, I got you a job."
"Later that evening, the couple I was in had a couple of hours"
to prepare a dinner party for a couple of couples.
Do your friends enjoy red wine?
Do you have any single male friends?
Are you tired of me already?
It's for this friend of mine.
Is this really how one finds love?
It's just what we do to distract ourselves until the real thing comes along.
I have a question for you.
You know I'll be in Paris for some time with my exhibition.
I'm going next week and I'm not sure when I'll come back.
"Unfortunately, having a man leave me for Paris was not foreign to me."
"Sure, I'll come for the opening and maybe another weekend also?"
I'm hoping you'll come and be with me.
For who knows when we'll come back?
But this was foreign to me.
"For most women, the goal of the dinner party is"
to have your friends feel comfortable around your boyfriend.
I think my maid is using my vibrator.
"Other times, you wish your friends were not quite so comfortable."
I don't think you're suppose to say maid anymore.
I don't think we're supposed to say vibrator over dinner.
I went into the kitchen to get it.
Why was it in the kitchen?
I like to mix it up.
"But yesterday, the batteries were dead."
They were new the last time I used it
and I haven't used it since Smith came back.
Now maybe in the other Republics people like to share vibrators
"but this is America, land of plenty."
I think you could have a potential lawsuit on your hands.
As long as it's not entering.
Tell us about your sculpture exhibition in Paris.
They are large scale light instillations integrated with video imaging.
And what's with the toilet paper?
Paris is the best city in the world.
"Easy fellow, you're talking to New Yorkers here."
New York is wonderful but there is nowhere like Paris.
"Well, we hadn't actually discussed the details but..."
"yes, I have been invited to go to Paris."
"Later, my friends wanted a tour of the apartment."
"A.k.a, time to ask me what the hell was going on."
You would go live with him?
When were you planning to tell us?
He just sprang this on me two hours ago.
Are you really thinking of going?
My boyfriend has just asked me to go to Paris with him.
This is the most romantic thing that has ever happened to me.
What do you think they're doing down there?
"Not having a Billy Joel sing a long, that's for sure."
I can't pretend to be one of the boys any longer.
I spoke to my girlfriends and they have a few questions about Paris.
But you are the one who's going.
Well we don't know about that yet.
Would I get my own place?
Why do you get your own place?
I have a beautiful apartment on the Left Bank.
So we would stay at the Plaza Athenee
Okay but are we talking a year?
Don't I need to learn French?
Would I be able to work there?
I think I drank too much Barolo at dinner.
I would pay for your apartment.
I can't let you do that.
But I don't have plenty of Carrie Bradshaws.
And I've always wanted to learn French and drink wine before noon so basically
it's my fantasy complete with Parisian parties and museum openings.
Cause I'd still have my apartment here.
Do you think you might get married?
I don't think that's the point.
Then what is he promising you?
Your column is all about New York.
How can you people still have questions?
I got all of your questions answered.
And they were good answers by the way.
So this is the time when everybody should be really excited for me.
"No, I think it's really romantic."
Then stop killing it with questions.
We just wanna make sure you think this through.
But it's a nice offer and it would be nice
if my friends could be happy for me.
Especially when I've always been happy for them.
"Carrie, we are happy for you."
They say the unexamined life it not worth living.
But what if the examining becomes your life?
Is that living or just procrastinating?
And what if all those helpful lunches and late night phone calls to friends
have made us all girl talk and no girl action?
Is it time to stop questioning?
Certain questions should never be asked by anyone.
Think someone's getting a little chunky?
which for a dog who used to weigh pounds seemed excessive.
Can you tell me where the diet dog food is?
But she's getting a little fat.
She's pregnant because everyone around me gets pregnant just not me.
It's not like she planned it.
She's not even thinking about it and bam
Well it might have been her first time but it was with at least dogs.
And we are gonna have to raise her whole trampy unpedigreed family.
"Elizabeth, mommy can't look at you right now."
This is all about Billy Joel.
We're not going to encourage you to cross an ocean.
We like you in New York.
"Well I like me in New York, too."
But he's got the goods to back it up.
And he can be really sweet.
Then why does Miranda not like him?
She didn't try to get to know him.
She didn't ask him one question all night
and she is all about the questions.
Have you ever heard me once ask what anybody thinks about my boyfriend?
I've never heard you use the term boyfriend.
My point is it doesn't matter.
Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors.
You know the most annoying thing?
Maybe I can't leave New York.
I don't know how I'd do some place else.
"Believe me, your fabulousness will translate."
And nobody says he gets to dictate the terms.
Figure out how to do it so you're comfortable.
"Maybe half the time you're there, half the time I'm there."
Well now you're being too supportive.
Later I still had questions filling my head.
But at least they were in French.
Yeah I just have to put my earrings on.
"I'm inviting you to go to France, not to jail."
Could we stay in New York and then...
just go to Paris for few months for your show?
Then it wouldn't feel like we're moving.
I need to be in Paris now.
I've been here for three years.
I'm not finished with New York.
Maybe we could... do long distance for a while?
"You know, someone meets someone, someone gets bored."
Normally a couple doesn't go from an ultimatum to a party.
But we were in charge of bringing something very important.
Looks like it's gonna start snowing out there.
They say it's going to be reminiscing of the 'nor'easter.
Martin is a food critic for Bon a Petite.
The coat check is right around the corner.
Where the fuck have you been hiding.
Lexi Featherington has been one of New York's legendary party girls
who always ended up on page because of her bar hopping and her bed hopping.
I'm gonna go up to the roof and have a smoke.
Are you still talking about him?
I've been thinking about this and it's how she is around him.
She's different and not in a good way.
"Miranda, no offense but you never think anyone's good enough for you and your friends."
You didn't' think I was good enough.
He's kind of full of himself.
"Let's not wake the kid, huh?"
"Miranda, if she moves, it'll be okay."
"Yeah, the best raw milk white cheddar"
I ever had was from a farm and guess where?
We now rival England for the best cheddar in the world.
"An hour later, I had somehow ended up on Enid's date."
"Actually, raw milk couldn't even be used in the States till recently"
It basically goes from the cow right to you.
And Enid had somehow ended up on mine.
"Martin, can you excuse me just for a minute?"
"You know, I have to tell you,"
I've been a fan of your work for longer than I'd like to admit.
I've been doing my work for longer than I'd like to admit.
"Oh Carrie, I love this man."
"Carrie, why aren't I with him?"
He's my age and you've got him and I am in no mance land.
"Man can date anyone any age, but let's be frank."
Most of them prefer the bimbos so...
"if you're a successful something woman,"
So why are you swimming in my wading pool?
It was another question I wasn't prepared to answer.
I need to go to the bathroom.
"Outside, the snow was starting to come down."
"And inside, it was going up."
"Close the door, close the door."
"Remember we used to go to Tunnel, we were like"
"No, I was trying to get away for a minute"
I don't know why I pulled strings to get an invite to this piece of shit party.
I'm so glad to see you though.
We're the only two single girls here.
"And speaking of little piece of shit parties,"
"No Harry, I cannot come to bed right now ."
because someone left me a little present.
Because someone is too pregnant to hold it in.
Yeah well someone isn't holding it in anymore.
"In fact, someone is giving birth in the bathroom."
"That night, Charlotte embraced her maternal instinct."
"And I, embraced my boyfriend for as long as I still had him."
"So now, Rama and I split our time between Los Angeles and Calcutta."
So she stays in our home in Calcutta while I headed our movies in Los Angeles.
They aren't together all the time.
"I want you wake up, you see me."
I want you everyday too but I have a life here.
But what do you want to come home to?
What do you want your life to be?
"No, Oh sorry I don't smoke anymore."
"Anyway, I'm just a huge fan of the pomegranate."
Do either you have a light?
Don't even know how she got in here.
How do you open this fucking thing?
"Now, our hostess has already said there's no smoking."
This is used to be the most exciting city in the world.
And now it's nothing but smoking near a fucking open window.
I'm so bored I could die.
It was the first time Lexi had ever left a party early.
"An hour later, the snow really started to fall."
I want to go to Paris.
It was a day made for first snows.
"Two days later, we said goodbye to our snow angel."
"Wait, she tripped on her Manolo?"
The scandal of the New York social scene and I missed it.
'I'm so bored I could die.'
This funeral is better than fashion week.
Marcus is saving us seats next to Hugh Jackman.
I didn't know Lexi had so many friends.
I thought I was the 'it' girl.
"Well, it's your word against a dead girl."
"You guys, we're suppose to be in mourning."
It's the end of an era.
"Ladies, if you are single in New York, after a certain point,"
there is nowhere to go but down.
Because you're afraid of going out a window?
Because I wanna open a new one.
We are done with the question portion of the program.
Now let's go say goodbye to Lexi.
"Well, it really is the end of an era."
"After the funeral, a couple of friends walked a couple of blocks."
You wanna get something to eat?
I'm not hungry but I'll go sit with you.
I can't believe you quit your job.
Couldn't you write the column there?
They weren't really into my American girl in Paris angle.
"New York paper, New York girl."
Got to be such a hassle so.
Are they gonna have someone new writing?
Probably some year old single girl with all new problems.
I think you're making a mistake.
"Carrie, you can't quit your column."
"No, it's not who I am, it's what I do."
I think I'm gonna go home.
I'm not allowed to have an opinion?
You've had it for quite some time.
What are you gonna do over there without your job?
Why can't you be happy for me?
I don't understand why you have to move away and give up your life.
I cannot stay in New York and be single for you.
"As long as I'm here, in the same place, writing my column"
"No, you moved on, Charlotte's moved on."
I can stay here and write about my life or I can go with him and live my life.
"Carrie I love you, come on."
Then don't you go to Paris with him.
Maybe I was living in a fantasy.
But I found a man who could make it a reality.
And I wasn't gonna question any of it.
Not even how he found a horse drawn sleigh in the middle of Manhattan.
Some outfits wait a lifetime to be taken somewhere special.
The same can be true of people.
"Stop packing, they have clothes here in Paris."
"No, this is not my fortieth please don't go to Paris call."
"It's been three weeks, is that funny yet."
"Anyway, I got us a dinner reservation."
so we have to eat at six.
"Which makes us senior citizens, thank you."
Or should I say merci beau.. please don't go.
"Look, I'd really like to see you, so call me."
"Same number and in case you've forgotten, it's.."
"After many more hours of packing,"
I was off for our version of the last supper.
"Well, if Mohammed won't come to the mountain."
"I was in the neighborhood, saw your light on."
"Well, I'm late for dinner with the girls."
"Come on, get in, it's cold."
"Raoul, give us a minute, would you?"
I'm sorry for not returning your calls.
"Yeah, I was starting to feel like a needy chick."
Did I do something to piss you off?
I've just been busy with other things.
"Look, I know I freaked out about us"
the last time I was here and I wanted to..
You were amazing to me and I just..
"And since then, I've been thinking a lot about us.."
"Look, you don't have to do this okay?"
Raoul's freezing and I have to go meet the girls.
I'm starting to feel like that chick again.
"You're finally taking that vacation, huh?"
I'm going there with a man that I'm in a relationship with.
"So, please don't feel bad about anything."
Saying goodbye and jumping out of the car like that?
When were you gonna tell me?
"What, you're not even gonna tell me who he is?"
You're moving to France with a Rusky?
"Oh, come on, it's a joke, Carrie."
"What do you have, some kind of radar?"
"Carrie might be happy, it's time to sweep in and shit all over it?"
"Look, I came here to tell you something."
You cannot do this to me again.
It's six years of never being different.
"But this is it, I am done."
"In fact, forget you know my name."
"And you can drive down this street all you want,"
because I don't live here anymore.
"Sure, now that I'm with someone else, now that I'm leaving, it's different."
"And just like in the fable, it's too little too late."
"Love, he said he loved you?"
"No, it's a.. No, it's an allegory.."
"Look, my point is, he's been doing this for years."
Then just put it all behind you.
I'm mostly upset about him ruining my last night in New York.
And you know I never say that.
"No, no, no, I can't be drunk on the plane."
I wanna arrive stunning and impossibly fresh looking.
She didn't even say anything yet.
I want to thank you all for wishing me well tonight.
In spite of some of your personal opinions about my leaving.
I've never had an opinion in my life.
what if I had never met you?
I'd like to show my face here again.
"Right, someone say something not sentimental."
Chemo might have kicked me into early menopause.
You cannot believe the hot flashes.
I can barely keep my clothes on.
What was your excuse before the chemo?
"Oh, I'm gonna miss you, you cunt."
"wow, even cunt didn't stop her."
"Hey, it's me, leave a message."
Car number downstairs in two minutes.
"Ladies, I know it's getting late and we all need to get up for our pilates."
But hang in and I know we can make this breast cancer benefit our best ever.
"first, we have the pink ribbon breast cancer cookie."
"Well, what's wrong with the cookie?"
"For the past five years, every fucking breast cancer benefit I've been to"
has had that fucking breast cancer cookie.
"Now, I don't care about a breast cancer cookie,"
"Well, some of the women coming to this event are battling cancer."
They need something more inspirational or outrageous than a fucking cookie.
"But you're right, we do this need something inspirational"
and outrageous to give to these women.
I'd like you to make a little speech before you bring me up.
Something you think they'd like to hear.
"My husband's parents, the Liebermans are coming, so please,"
try not to say fuck so much.
"Could I get some water, please?"
Nous sommes ravi de vous accueillir?
"A little slow, s'il vous plait."
I'm staying here with Aleksandr Petrovsky.
I believe Mr. Petrovsky is in the salon right now.
I want you to meet my daughter Chloe.
Je suis juste en train de vivre le pire jour de ma vie.
Et il est encore que dix heures et demie ?
"I'm sorry, all I got was it's ten thirty."
Chloe was saying that she's having a bad day
and she wants to kill herself.
So tell me all about the bum.
Papa tells me this is your first visit to Paris.
"Well, not if you include movies."
But I can't believe I'm finally here.
I almost screamed when we drove by Eiffel Tower.
"but now with that light show at night, hideous, just hideous."
I wanted Chloe to meet us for drinks tonight
"but only time she could give her old papa is from now till this afternoon, so..."
"Oh, well, you two should have your day alone."
"You know, all the interpreting for me is going to cut your time in half."
I can unpack and take a nap and try to get on Paris time.
"Also, I have to meet some people from the museum for an early dinner,"
"but I'll eat light so we could go out then, ok?"
It was nice to meet you too.
all dressed up and no Petrovsky to go.
"Oh, where is the recommendation from your friend, the judge."
And Carrie left hers at home so I can pick it up when I get her mail later in the week.
It's amazing with all the unwanted children we have to do all this.
"Well, this private adoption is a very competitive market."
We got like a year's wait on that list.
"Honey, god is gonna send us a baby from somewhere."
And it's just our job to file all the papers
and to just be as aggressive as we can up to the point we're obnoxious.
This museum dinner turned into this big long thing
with the exhibit sponsors and other?
You had the do not disturb on your phone.
It's dinner time in New York.
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten
"If you want to see the face of breast cancer, look around you."
"It's the woman next to you at the dry cleaners,"
the single mother picking her child up from school.
Are you sure the heat is off?
She's the woman with a knowing smile.
"A smile that says I beat cancer,"
I can take on the world.
I just thought it would sound more like you.
"At AA, the most inspirational speakers are the ones who keep it real."
"I'm speaking at a black tie benefit, not chillin' at P Diddy's crib."
I'm saying that truth is powerful.
"Look, you may know AA, but I know PR."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I simply must stick my head in the freezer."
I decided my french was now strong enough to brave the ultimate test.
"I fell in Dior, so I decided that the more I purchased,"
the less they think of me as the American who fell in Dior.
This is the shopping equivalent of lobotomy.
"My purse went flying, I had to scoop everything up."
I came all the way from New York to squat and scoop in Dior.
I didn't even bother to check and see if I had all my credit cards.
One that I won't be using again for many many years.
My Carrie necklace was in here.
I put it in here and I don't see it.
"No, I can't have lost my Carrie necklace."
"No, no, it's not like that."
It costs like nothing but it's priceless.
"I've just had it forever, so.."
"Mais, qu'est ce qui se passe?"
I lost my Carrie necklace and it's gone and...
I'll never be able to replace it
and I got it at that street fair when we were all together
and... it just makes me so sad.
"Well, no one in Paris seems to understand or at least they don't understand me."
"It's ridiculous, I just got here."
I've just only been here a week.
"So, aside from the necklace how's it going?"
I don't speak the language and...
it's too cold and rainy to walk around all day.
"I've been to every museum, you know, like twice."
"I don't know, I'm just sort of lost."
"Well, the exhibit is taking much more time than he thought,"
"It's ridiculous, I just got here."
"No, I'm just being a baby, you know."
I saw these girls having lunch and..
I just thought how much I missed you guys.
I've wanted to come here my whole life.
"I just have, you know, too much time to think."
Can I tell you something and you won't use it against me
when I feel better and everything's great?
About... what it would be like if I come here with Big.
"But that's just something I do when things aren't going perfect with any guy,"
"you know, I compare him to Big."
"Oh god, this French phone is saying something that I don't understand."
"If you want to see the face of breast cancer, look around you."
"It's the woman next to you at the dry cleaners,"
the single mother picking her child up from school.
"And if any of you are having hot flashes like I am, you deserve a fucking medal."
"Bad enough I lose my hair, now I have my face running down my couture."
To: Mommy Charlotte From: Carrie Baby Recommandation
"Hey it's me, leave a message."
I know you said you never wanted me to call you again.
I don't even know if you're calling this number but I had to call.
"I figured at this point, I've got nothing to lose except you."
"I can't lose you again, Carrie."
And her computer was just sitting there on her bed.
"Well, I know I haven't been your favorite over the few years."
"Well, god knows I've made a lot of mistakes with Carrie."
You three know her better than anyone.
You're the loves of her life.
And a guy's just lucky to come in fourth.
"And if you think I have the slightest chance,"
"I'll be on the next plane to Paris, I'll roam the streets until I find her."
"But if you think that she really is happy,"
"well, I wouldn't want to wreck that for her."
I know this is not the Carrie necklace.
"Well, let's just say I wouldn't throw it around in your old purse."
I hope this cheer you up.
"Listen, I know I've been busy."
"As soon as the exhibit opens,"
"it will be just you and me, ok?"
"This is Andre, my best friend."
it was time for the ultimate in sophisticated French fare:
meeting your lover and his ex wife for lunch.
It's nice to finally meet you.
"Well if I'm fashionably late, then Alec is very fashionable."
The silk lining's about a hundred million years old but I'm so in love with it.
I represent accessories for the collections.
Alec's never mentioned what work you did.
some gigantic decoration problem with the sculpture number something.
Nothing else exist when art does.
Well this is a fantastic restaurant.
I'm gonna shoplift just so he can feel me up.
I need something simple to wear for when we meet the birth parents.
Where is this couple from again?
I think it's a good sign.
Very TV Movie of the week.
"Stylish social couple opens up their park avenue home to the dumb,"
"And you'd be played by Barbara Parkins,"
And I'd be played by Collin Farrell.
Do you think you look like Collin Farrell?
"So in your movie, how big is my part?"
I'll still be in your life right?
Because once people have the babies.
You'll always be in my life Collin Farrell.
Can you believe this is finally happening?
Well if it does I know some gays that got a Guatemalan kid and they like love it.
A touch of this blonde is going be perfection.
Save it little for him because he is one hot piece of ash.
Are we ever gonna talk about the fact that we haven't had sex in a long time?
My therapist said not to mention it in bed.
Since when have you been seeing a therapist?
I just thought I should get some help to deal with all this cancer stuff.
I just think we should talk about it.
I have absolutely no sex drive.
You're leaving town to do a movie.
What's the point of talking about it right now?
I see two pairs of feet in there.
You had better not be doing it.
I must admit I've been dying to meet you.
I begged Aleks to organize a dinner with us.
"But he said as soon as the exhibit opens, we'd all sit down."
"As soon as, as soon as."
If I heard this phrase one more time.
"Can I just say, I think it's lovelythat you both think so highly of one another."
But I believe a relationship is like a couture?
"it doesn't fit perfectly, it's a disaster."
And I couldn't quite get used to always coming second.
I thought you might be one of those Americans who didn't smoke.
And I would be.. how do you say.
Guilty of killing you over lunch?
Chloe tells me you were a write in New York.
Until recently I had a weekly column in New York.
And Aleks is comfortable with that?
Aren't you gonna say anything about the fact that I'm smoking?
"Juliet was impressed that you're beautiful, smart and chic."
It's been like this all week.
I thought we'd at least have the morning together.
Is this going to be everyday?
Don't make me feel worse than I do.
I'm not trying to make you feel worse.
I said nothing when you left me alone with your wife.
I know it's inconvenient for you right now.
There will be more time for us as soon as this exhibit opens.
The whole house is coming together.
What's little Stevie doing over there?
Does my mother seem odd to you?
She looks all loopy and she's disoriented.
It's called the one too many beers syndrome.
Her eye's not focused or something.
Don't let little Stevie have any strawberry.
But who the hell are you?
I'm gonna run down to the emergency room and check it out.
If it's a movie about Attila the Hun why are they filming in Canada?
And it's pretty much just open space.
Which means nowhere to go and nothing to do for the next weeks.
I want you to feel free to have sex while you're on location.
I'm not trying to push you away.
"If anyone knows how important sex is to a person, it's me."
Your body just needs time to heal itself.
"Just because the trees are bare, doesn't mean they're dead."
I want you to have sex.
I don't' wanna just have sex.
But when you're riding a horse all day.
"Wearing animal fur, and you see some sexy Canadian extra in a slave girl outfit,"
You're playing a barbarian for fuck's sake.
I'll be in there in a minute.
The doctor says she had a small stroke.
"Best you can tell, maybe a week ago?"
But nobody knows cause she's been home alone.
I want her to stay here with us tonight.
So I'm gonna run and grab her nightgown and stuff.
Magda can stay here with them.
She's always waiting for me to pick her up downstairs.
My ma can't live like this.
We'll get a maid or nurse or someone to live with her full time.
You can hire them to do that right?
My ma can't live like this.
Your mother can come live with us.
Why else do we have that big house?
You're Sex on the City writer?
I love Sex on the City.
"I am a, how do you say, the single girl."
We want to make a party for you.
"Apparently, I fell right into my French fan base."
They were so fun and silly.
And they insisted on throwing a party in my honor.
They want me to meet their friends who supposedly love the book as well.
It's just a cozy dinner and a quite hotel in Paris with my ten new French friends.
This is what I love about Paris.
You never know what they day will lead you.
"Anyway, the party is Saturday night at the La Petite Augberge on the Rue St. Andre des Artes"
That's the night I unveil my show to the museum curators and stuff.
But you go and have a wonderful time.
With the throngs of screaming fans.
I don't mind if I do.
Do you think they'll really be screaming?
And we turned the office back there into a baby's room.
We're within blocks of the best grammar schools in Manhattan.
Not that we would ever let him or her go alone.
We weren't gonna ask cause I didn't wanna know nothing about it.
But then I was there and they asked if I wanted to know and I said yes.
Ever since then I've been thinkingabout little girl names.
Wayne says I like any name with a 'ney' in the end.
"We're not getting the baby, are we?"
"If you knew this before, why did you come here and put us through all this?"
What are you doing in here all this time?
I'm writing an angry e mail to our baby lawyer.
She warned about this kind of thing.
"How much more can we take, huh?"
Beginning to think God lost our address.
We've been through worse than this.
And you know how I said you could have sex with someone else?
"Well, if it would be okay with you, try not to."
Unless you already have and then that's fine.
I don't mean to be a wet blanket but how about 'don't'?
It's the cufflinks.. and something with my hands it's just
I think I'm having an anxiety attack
Put your head between your legs and breathe.
What if they think I'm the old man with a silly light machines.
"Here, let me do this for you."
I don't have anybody's telephone number to call and cancel.
And promise not to let go all night.
I wanna take little Stevie to the zoo.
Some days she's perfectly clear and then she'll have a bad couple of days like now.
How are you handling all this?
He gets home from the bar late and then he's with her all day.
Let's get ready to go to the zoo.
The one place in Paris you can't smoke.
Tell that man I had to go.
How could you just abandon me like that when I gave up my party to be with you.
I sat on a bench alone in a museum.
I am a person in this relationship.
Have you any idea what it's been like for me here?
Eating alone and waiting for my boyfriend who would rather spend time with a light instillation?
I had a life in New York.
I had a job and friends and I didn't give all of that up to come here
and wonder the streets of Paris alone.
I'm taking a shower and I'm going to bed.
We will talk more as soon as
I thought I was clear all along about who I am.
Maybe it's time to be clear about who I am.
I am someone who is looking for love.
consuming can't live without each other love.
in this expensive suite and this lovely hotel in Paris.
But we have only double rooms available.
"Well, I'm a single and it would be fine."
Let me see just a minute.
I never should have come here.
We had a big fight and then I got slapped.
I see you were in room
What do you think you're doing?
I think I'm kicking some Russian ass.
I don't need you to do this.
What do you think you're doing?
You're gonna have a heart attack.
It took care of this myself.
I don't need you to rescue me.
I'm clocking this foreigner and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
I gotta hand it to you kid.
Most people come to Paris to fall in love.
how did you even get here?
It took me a really long time to get here.
I got something from China too.
I guess God remembered our address.
We get her in six months.
Let's not make a big deal of it to Steve.
I forgot to tell you something on the phone.
You flew back to tell me that?
Can you think of a better reason?
You have been more to me than any man I've ever known.
And the Four Season's won't check you in until one.
"Later that day, I got to thinking about relationships."
There are those that open you up to something new and exotic.
Those that are old and familiar.
Those that bring up lots of questions.
Those that bring you somewhere unexpected.
Those that bring you far from where you started.
And those that bring you back.
"But the most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all"
is the one you have with yourself.
"And if you find someone to love the you, you love,"
The house is on the market.
